              "\" PART 1 Introduction to Software EngineeringMy aim in this part of the book is to provide a general introduction tosoftware engineering. I introduce important concepts such as softwareprocesses and agile methods, and describe essential software developmentactivities, from initial software specification through to system evolution.The chapters in this part have been designed to support a one-semestercourse in software engineering.   Chapter 1 is a general introduction that introduces professional software   engineering and defines some software engineering concepts. I have   also written a brief discussion of ethical issues in software engineering.    I think that it is important for software engineers to think about the   wider implications of their work. This chapter also introduces three case   studies that I use in the book, namely a system for managing records of   patients undergoing treatment for mental health problems, a control   system for a portable insulin pump and a wilderness weather system.   Chapters 2 and 3 cover software engineering processes and agile devel-   opment. In Chapter 2, I introduce commonly used generic software   process models, such as the waterfall model, and I discuss the basic   activities that are part of these processes. Chapter 3 supplements this   with a discussion of agile development methods for software engineer-   ing. I mostly use Extreme Programming as an example of an agile method   but also briefly introduce Scrum in this chapter.19The remainder of the  chapters in this  part  are extended descriptions  ofthe software   process activities   that  will   be introduced   in  Chapter  2.Chapter 4 covers the critically important  topic of requirements  engineer-ing, where the  requirements  for  what a  system should do  are defined.Chapter 5 introduces system modeling  using the UML, where I  focus onthe use of  use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams,  andstate diagrams  for  modeling  a software  system.  Chapter 6 introducesarchitectural design and I discuss the importance of  architecture and theuse of architectural patterns in  software design.Chapter 7 introduces object-oriented  design  and the use  of design pat-terns. I also introduce important implementation  issues here—reuse, con-figuration  management, and host-target  development and discuss opensource development. Chapter 8 focuses on software testing from unit test-ing during system development to the testing  of software releases. I alsodiscuss the use of  test-driven  development—an approach pioneered  inagile methods but  which  has wide applicability.  Finally, Chapter 9 pres-ents  an  overview   of   software   evolution    issues.  I  cover  evolutionprocesses, software maintenance, and legacy system management.20  1Introduction            Objectives            The objectives of this chapter are to introduce software engineering and            to provide a framework for understanding the rest of the book. When you            have read this chapter you will:            \\x02 understand what software engineering is and why it is important;            \\x02 understand that the development of different types of software                systems may require different software engineering techniques;            \\x02 understand some ethical and professional issues that are important                for software engineers;            \\x02 have been introduced to three systems, of different types, that will be                used as examples throughout the book.           Contents           1.1 Professional software development           1.2 Software engineering ethics           1.3 Case studies214 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                   We can’t run the modern world  without  software. National  infrastructures and utili-                                   ties are controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a                                   computer  and controlling   software.  Industrial   manufacturing   and distribution   is                                   completely  computerized,  as is the financial  system. Entertainment,  including   the                                   music  industry,  computer  games, and film   and television,   is software  intensive.                                   Therefore, software engineering is essential for the functioning of  national and inter-                                   national societies.                                        Software systems are abstract  and intangible.  They  are not constrained  by  the                                   properties of materials,  governed by physical  laws, or by  manufacturing processes.                                   This simplifies  software engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of                                   software. However, because of the lack of physical constraints, software systems can                                   quickly  become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.                                        There are many different types of  software systems, from simple  embedded sys-                                   tems to complex, worldwide  information systems. It is pointless to look for  universal                                   notations, methods, or  techniques for software  engineering because different types                                   of software  require different  approaches. Developing an organizational information                                   system is completely  different  from  developing  a controller  for  a scientific  instru-                                   ment. Neither of these systems has much in common with a graphics-intensive com-                                   puter game. All of these applications need software engineering; they do not all need                                   the same software engineering techniques.                                        There are still many reports of software projects going wrong and ‘software failures’.                                   Software engineering is  criticized  as inadequate for modern software development.                                   However, in my view, many of  these so-called software failures are a consequence of                                   two factors:                                   1. Increasing     demands As new software  engineering techniques help  us to build                                          larger, more  complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be  built                                          and delivered  more quickly;   larger, even more complex  systems are required;                                          systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impos-                                          sible.  Existing  software  engineering  methods cannot  cope and new  software                                          engineering techniques have to be developed to meet new these new demands.                                   2. Low    expectations It is relatively  easy to write computer programs without  using                                          software  engineering methods  and techniques. Many  companies  have drifted                                          into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do                                          not use software  engineering  methods in  their everyday  work.  Consequently,                                          their  software is  often more expensive and  less reliable than it  should  be. We                                          need better software engineering education and training to address this problem.                                        Software engineers can be rightly proud of their  achievements. Of course we still                                   have problems developing complex  software but, without  software engineering,  we                                   would not have explored space, would not have the Internet or modern telecommuni-                                   cations. All  forms of travel would  be more dangerous and expensive. Software engi-                                   neering has contributed a great deal and I am convinced that its contributions  in  the                                   21st century will  be even greater.22                                                                                       1.1 \\x02 Professional    software  development 5              History of software engineeringThe notion of ‘software engineering’ was first proposed in 1968 at a conference held to discuss what was thencalled the ‘software crisis’ (Naur and Randell, 1969). It became clear that individual approaches to programdevelopment did not scale up to large and complex software systems. These were unreliable, cost more thanexpected, and were delivered late.   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a variety of new software engineering techniques and methods weredeveloped, such as structured programming, information hiding and object-oriented development. Tools andstandard notations were developed and are now extensively used.                                      http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/History/                   1.1 Professional                    software           development                              Lots of  people write   programs. People in  business write  spreadsheet programs to                              simplify  their  jobs, scientists and engineers write  programs to process their experi-                              mental data,  and hobbyists  write  programs for  their  own  interest and enjoyment.                              However, the vast majority of  software development is a professional activity  where                              software is developed for  specific business purposes, for inclusion in  other devices,                              or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional                              software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed                              by teams rather than individuals. It  is maintained and changed throughout its life.                                  Software  engineering is  intended to support professional  software development,                              rather than  individual  programming.   It  includes techniques  that support  program                              specification,  design, and evolution,  none  of which  are normally   relevant for  per-                              sonal software development. To help you to get a broad view of what software  engi-                              neering is about, I have summarized some frequently asked questions in Figure 1.1.                                  Many  people think  that software is simply  another word for  computer programs.                              However, when we  are talking  about software engineering, software  is not just  the                              programs themselves but also all  associated documentation and configuration  data                              that is required  to make  these programs operate correctly. A  professionally  devel-                              oped software system is often more than a single program. The system usually  con-                              sists of a number of separate programs and configuration files that are used to set up                              these programs. It may include system documentation, which describes the structure                              of the system; user documentation, which explains how  to use the system, and web-                              sites for users to download recent product information.                                  This  is one of  the important  differences between professional  and amateur soft-                              ware development. If you  are writing  a program for yourself,  no one else will  use it                              and you don’t  have to  worry  about writing  program  guides, documenting  the pro-                              gram design, etc. However, if you are writing  software that other people will use and                              other engineers will  change then you usually have to provide additional information                              as well as the code of the program.236 Chapter       1 \\x02 Introduction     Question                                                                               Answer     What is software?

What are the attributes of good  software?                          Good software should  deliver the required                                                                                                  functionality  and performance to the  user and should                                                                                                  be maintainable,  dependable, and usable.     What is software engineering?                                             Software engineering is an engineering discipline that                                                                                                  is concerned with  all aspects of software production.     What are the fundamental software  engineering                Software specification, software development,     activities?                                                                             software validation,  and software evolution.     What is the difference between software                             Computer science focuses on theory and     engineering and computer  science?                                   fundamentals; software  engineering is concerned                                                                                                  with  the practicalities of developing and delivering                                                                                                  useful software.     What is the difference between software                             System engineering is concerned with all aspects of     engineering and system engineering?                                 computer-based systems development including                                                                                                  hardware, software, and process engineering. Software                                                                                                  engineering is part of this more general process.     What are the key challenges facing software                      Coping with  increasing diversity, demands for reduced     engineering?                                                                        delivery times, and developing  trustworthy software.     What are the costs of software engineering?                       Roughly 60% of software costs are development                                                                                                  costs; 40% are testing costs. For custom software,                                                                                                  evolution  costs often exceed development costs.     What are the best software engineering techniques            While all software projects have to be professionally     and methods?                                                                      managed and developed, different  techniques are                                                                                                  appropriate for  different types of system. For example,                                                                                                  games should always be developed using a series of                                                                                                  prototypes whereas safety critical control systems                                                                                                  require a complete  and analyzable specification to be                                                                                                  developed. You can’t, therefore, say that one method                                                                                                  is better than  another.     What differences has the Web made to software                The Web has led to the availability of software     engineering?                                                                        services and the possibility of developing  highly                                                                                                  distributed  service-based systems. Web-based                                                                                                  systems development has led to important  advances                                                                                                  in programming  languages and software reuse.                                            Software    engineers   are  concerned   with   developing    software   products   (i.e.,   soft-Figure 1.1 Frequentlyasked questions about ware    which   can  be sold  to  a customer).   There  are  two  kinds  of  software   products:software                                       1. Generic       products These   are  stand-alone   systems  that are  produced  by  a develop-                                               ment  organization     and sold   on the  open  market   to  any  customer   who  is  able  to24                                                                     1.1 \\x02 Professional    software  development 7                   buy  them. Examples of  this  type of  product include  software  for PCs such as                   databases, word processors, drawing packages, and project-management tools.                   It  also includes so-called  vertical  applications designed for  some specific pur-                   pose such as library  information   systems, accounting systems, or  systems for                   maintaining  dental records.            2. Customized    (or bespoke) products These are systems that are commissioned by                   a particular  customer. A  software  contractor  develops the software  especially                   for  that customer. Examples of this type of software include  control systems for                   electronic  devices, systems written to support a particular business process, and                   air traffic  control  systems.                 An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products,            the organization that develops the software controls the software specification. For cus-            tom products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization            that is buying the software. The software developers must work to that specification.                 However,  the  distinction    between  these system  product   types  is  becoming            increasingly  blurred.  More  and  more systems are now  being built   with  a generic            product  as a base, which  is then  adapted to  suit the  requirements of  a customer.            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)  systems, such as the SAP system, are the best            examples of this  approach. Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a com-            pany  by  incorporating   information   about  business  rules and  processes, reports            required, and so on.                 When we  talk  about the quality  of  professional  software,  we have to  take into            account that the software  is used and changed by people apart from  its developers.            Quality  is therefore not just concerned with what  the software does. Rather, it has to            include the software’s behavior while it is executing and the structure and organization            of  the system programs and associated documentation. This is reflected in so-called            quality or non-functional  software attributes. Examples of these attributes are the soft-            ware’s response time to a user query and the understandability of the program code.                 The specific set of attributes  that you might expect from  a software system obvi-            ously  depends on its application.  Therefore,  a banking  system must be secure, an            interactive game must be responsive, a telephone switching system must be reliable,            and so on. These can be generalized into  the set of  attributes shown in  Figure 1.2,            which  I believe are the essential characteristics of a professional software system.1.1.1 Software        engineering            Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of            software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintain-            ing the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:            1. Engineering     discipline Engineers make things work. They apply  theories, meth-                   ods, and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively258 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction    Product characteristics                             Description    Maintainability                                          Software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to                                                                     meet the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute                                                                     because software change is an inevitable requirement of a                                                                     changing business environment.    Dependability and security                       Software dependability includes a range of characteristics                                                                     including reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software                                                                     should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of                                                                     system failure. Malicious users should not be able to access or                                                                     damage the system.    Efficiency                                                  Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such                                                                     as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes                                                                     responsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc.    Acceptability                                             Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is                                                                     designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable, and                                                                     compatible with other systems that they use.                                          and always try  to discover solutions to  problems even when there are no appli-Figure 1.2 Essentialattributes of good              cable theories  and methods. Engineers also  recognize that they  must work  tosoftware                            organizational  and financial  constraints so they look  for  solutions within  these                                          constraints.                                   2. All     aspects of software production Software   engineering is  not just  concerned                                          with  the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities                                          such as software project  management and the development of  tools, methods,                                          and theories to support software production.                                        Engineering is  about getting  results of the  required quality  within   the schedule                                   and budget. This often involves  making compromises—engineers cannot be perfec-                                   tionists. People writing  programs for  themselves, however, can spend as much time                                   as they wish on the program development.                                        In general, software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their                                   work,  as this  is  often  the most  effective  way  to  produce  high-quality   software.                                   However, engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for  a set of                                   circumstances  so a more  creative,  less formal  approach  to development  may  be                                   effective in  some circumstances. Less formal development is  particularly  appropri-                                   ate for the  development of web-based systems, which  requires a blend of  software                                   and graphical design skills.                                        Software engineering is important for  two reasons:                                   1. More    and more, individuals  and society rely on advanced software systems. We                                          need to be able to  produce reliable and trustworthy   systems economically and                                          quickly.26                                                        1.1 \\x02 Professional     software development 92. It    is  usually cheaper, in the long  run, to use software engineering methods and       techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a       personal programming project. For  most types of systems, the majority of costs       are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use.    The systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes calleda software process. A software  process is a sequence of activities  that leads to  theproduction of a software product. There are four fundamental activities that are com-mon to all software processes. These activities are:1. Software    specification,  where customers and engineers define the software that       is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.2. Software    development, where the software is designed and programmed.3. Software    validation,  where the software is checked to ensure that it  is what the       customer requires.4. Software    evolution, where the software is modified to reflect  changing customer       and market requirements.    Different   types of  systems need different development  processes. For example,real-time software in  an aircraft has to be completely  specified before  developmentbegins. In e-commerce systems, the specification and the program are usually devel-oped together. Consequently, these generic activities may be organized  in differentways and described at different  levels  of detail  depending on  the type of  softwarebeing developed. I describe software processes in more detail in Chapter 2.    Software engineering is related to both computer science and systems engineering:1. Computer    science is concerned with the theories and methods that underlie com-       puters and software systems, whereas software engineering is concerned with the       practical problems of producing software. Some knowledge of computer science       is essential  for software  engineers  in the  same way that  some knowledge  of       physics is essential for electrical engineers. Computer science theory, however, is       often most applicable to relatively small  programs. Elegant theories of computer       science cannot always be applied to large, complex problems that require a soft-       ware solution.2. System    engineering is concerned with  all  aspects of the development and evo-       lution of  complex systems where software plays a major role. System engineer-       ing  is therefore  concerned  with  hardware  development,   policy  and process       design and system deployment, as well  as software engineering.  System engi-       neers are involved  in specifying   the system, defining   its overall  architecture,       and then integrating  the different  parts to create the finished  system. They are       less concerned  with  the  engineering  of  the  system components  (hardware,       software, etc.).2710 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                   As I discuss in the next section, there are many different types of software. There is no                                   universal software engineering method or technique that is applicable for all of these.                                   However, there are three general issues that affect many different types of software:                                   1. Heterogeneity Increasingly,   systems are required to operate as distributed systems                                          across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. As                                          well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also have to execute                                          on mobile phones. You often have to integrate new software with older legacy sys-                                          tems written in different programming languages. The challenge here is to develop                                          techniques for building dependable software that is flexible enough to cope with                                          this heterogeneity.                                   2. Business   and social change Business and society are changing incredibly quickly                                          as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They                                          need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new soft-                                          ware. Many traditional  software engineering techniques are time consuming and                                          delivery of  new systems often takes longer than planned. They need to evolve so                                          that the time required for software to deliver value to its customers is reduced.                                   3. Security    and trust As  software  is intertwined  with  all  aspects of our lives, it  is                                          essential that we can trust that software. This  is especially true for  remote soft-                                          ware systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to                                          make sure that malicious users cannot attack our software and that  information                                          security is maintained.                                        Of course, these are not independent issues. For example, it may be necessary to                                   make rapid changes to a legacy system to provide it with a web service interface. To                                   address these challenges we will need new tools and techniques as well as innovative                                   ways of combining  and using existing software engineering methods.                      1.1.2 Software         engineering      diversity                                   Software  engineering is  a systematic approach  to the production   of software  that                                   takes into account practical  cost, schedule, and dependability  issues, as well as the                                   needs of software customers and producers. How  this systematic approach is  actu-                                   ally implemented  varies dramatically  depending on the organization developing  the                                   software, the type of  software, and the people involved in  the development process.                                   There are no universal  software engineering  methods and techniques that are suit-                                   able for all  systems and all companies. Rather, a diverse set of software engineering                                   methods and tools has evolved over the past 50 years.                                        Perhaps the most significant  factor  in  determining  which  software engineering                                   methods and techniques are most important  is the type  of application  that is  being                                   developed. There are many different types of application including:                                   1. Stand-alone    applications These are application systems that run on a local com-                                          puter, such as a PC. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to28                                                      1.1 \\x02 Professional    software  development 11       be connected to a network.  Examples  of such  applications are office  applica-       tions on a PC, CAD programs, photo manipulation  software, etc.2. Interactive     transaction-based applications These  are applications  that execute       on a remote  computer and  that are accessed by users from  their  own  PCs or       terminals. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce appli-       cations where you can interact with  a remote system to buy goods and services.       This  class of  application   also includes   business systems,  where a  business       provides access to its systems through a web browser or special-purpose client       program and cloud-based services, such as mail and photo  sharing. Interactive       applications often incorporate  a large data store that is accessed and updated in       each transaction.3. Embedded   control  systems These are software control systems that control and       manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded sys-       tems than any other type of system. Examples of embedded systems include the       software in  a mobile (cell)  phone, software that controls  anti-lock  braking  in a       car, and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking  process.4. Batch     processing  systems These are  business systems that  are  designed to       process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to       create corresponding   outputs.  Examples  of  batch  systems include  periodic       billing  systems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.5. Entertainment    systems These are systems that are primarily for personal use and       which are intended to entertain the user. Most of these systems are games of one       kind or another. The quality of  the user interaction offered is the most important       distinguishing  characteristic of entertainment systems.6. Systems   for  modeling and simulation These  are systems that are developed by       scientists  and  engineers  to  model  physical   processes or  situations,   which       include  many, separate, interacting  objects.  These are often  computationally       intensive and require high-performance parallel systems for execution.7. Data    collection  systems These are systems that collect data from their environ-       ment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.       The software has to interact with sensors and often is installed in a hostile envi-       ronment such as inside an engine or in a remote location.8. Systems   of systems These are systems that are composed of a number of other       software systems. Some of  these may be generic software products,  such as a       spreadsheet program. Other systems in the assembly may  be specially written       for that environment.    Of  course, the boundaries between these system types are blurred. If you developa game for a mobile (cell) phone, you have to take into account the same constraints(power, hardware interaction)  as the developers of  the phone software.  Batch pro-cessing systems are often used in conjunction with web-based systems. For example,2912 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                   in a company, travel expense claims may be submitted through a web application but                                   processed in a batch application for monthly  payment.                                        You use  different   software  engineering   techniques  for  each  type  of  system                                   because the software has quite different characteristics. For  example, an embedded                                   control  system in  an automobile  is  safety-critical   and is  burned into  ROM  when                                   installed in the vehicle. It is therefore very  expensive to change. Such a system needs                                   very extensive verification  and validation so that the chances of having to recall cars                                   after sale to  fix  software problems  are minimized.  User interaction  is  minimal  (or                                   perhaps nonexistent) so there is no need to use a development process that relies on                                   user interface prototyping.                                        For a web-based system, an approach based on iterative development and delivery                                   may be  appropriate,  with   the system  being  composed of  reusable  components.                                   However,  such an approach  may be  impractical   for  a system of  systems, where                                   detailed specifications of  the system interactions have to be specified in  advance so                                   that each system can be separately developed.                                        Nevertheless, there are software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types                                   of software system:                                   1. They     should  be  developed  using  a managed  and  understood  development                                          process. The organization developing the software should plan the development                                          process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will  be com-                                          pleted. Of course, different  processes are used for different types of software.                                   2. Dependability     and performance are important for all types of systems. Software                                          should  behave as expected, without   failures  and should  be available  for  use                                          when it  is  required. It  should  be safe in  its operation  and, as far  as possible,                                          should be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently                                          and should not waste resources.                                   3. Understanding    and managing the software specification and requirements (what                                          the software should do) are important. You have to know what different customers                                          and users of the system expect from it and you have to manage their expectations                                          so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule.                                   4. You    should make as effective use as possible of existing resources. This means                                          that, where appropriate, you should  reuse software that has already been devel-                                          oped rather than write new software.                                        These fundamental notions of process, dependability, requirements, management,                                   and reuse are important themes of this book.  Different  methods reflect them in  dif-                                   ferent ways but they underlie all  professional software development.                                        You should notice that these fundamentals do not cover implementation and pro-                                   gramming. I don’t  cover specific programming techniques in this book because these                                   vary dramatically  from  one type of system to another. For example, a scripting  lan-                                   guage such as Ruby is used for web-based system programming but would be com-                                   pletely inappropriate  for embedded systems engineering.30                                                                   1.1 \\x02 Professional    software  development 131.1.3 Software         engineering      and   the   Web             The development of  the World  Wide  Web has had a profound  effect on  all  of our             lives. Initially,  the Web was primarily  a universally  accessible information store and             it had little   effect on software  systems. These systems ran on local computers  and             were only accessible from within   an organization. Around  2000, the Web started to             evolve and more  and more functionality    was added to  browsers. This  meant that             web-based systems could  be developed where,  instead of  a special-purpose  user             interface,  these systems could  be accessed using a web  browser.  This  led to  the             development of a vast range of new system products that delivered innovative  serv-             ices, accessed over the Web. These are often funded by adverts that are displayed on             the user’s screen and do not involve direct payment from users.                 As  well  as these system products, the development of  web browsers  that could             run small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and             organizational software. Instead of writing   software and deploying it  on users’ PCs,             the software was deployed  on a web server. This  made it much  cheaper to change             and upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. It             also  reduced  costs,  as  user  interface   development   is  particularly    expensive.             Consequently, wherever it has been possible to do so, many businesses have moved             to web-based interaction with company software systems.                 The  next stage in the development of  web-based systems was the notion of web             services. Web services are software components that deliver specific, useful function-             ality and which are accessed over the Web. Applications are constructed by integrating             these web services, which may be provided by different companies. In principle, this             linking can be dynamic so that an application may use different web services each time             that it is executed. I cover this approach to software development in Chapter 19.                 In  the last few years, the notion of  ‘software  as a service’ has been developed. It             has been proposed that software will  not normally   run on local  computers but will             run on ‘computing  clouds’  that  are accessed over the Internet. If you  use a service             such as web-based mail, you are using a cloud-based system. A computing cloud is             a huge number of linked  computer systems that is  shared by many users. Users do             not buy software  but pay according to  how much  the software is used or  are given             free access in return for watching adverts that are displayed on their screen.                 The  advent of the web, therefore, has led to  a significant  change in the way that             business software is organized. Before  the web, business applications were  mostly             monolithic,   single  programs  running  on single  computers  or  computer  clusters.             Communications were local, within  an organization. Now, software is highly  distrib-             uted, sometimes across the world. Business applications  are not programmed from             scratch but involve extensive reuse of components and programs.                 This  radical change in software organization has, obviously, led to changes in the             ways that web-based systems are engineered. For example:             1. Software    reuse has become the dominant approach for constructing  web-based                    systems. When building  these systems, you think about how you  can assemble                    them from pre-existing  software components and systems.3114 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                   2. It     is now  generally recognized  that it  is impractical  to  specify  all the require-                                          ments for  such systems in  advance. Web-based systems should be developed                                          and delivered incrementally.                                   3. User    interfaces are constrained  by the capabilities  of  web browsers. Although                                          technologies such as AJAX  (Holdener,  2008) mean that  rich interfaces can be                                          created within  a web browser, these technologies are still  difficult   to use. Web                                          forms with  local  scripting  are more commonly  used. Application  interfaces on                                          web-based systems are often poorer than the specially designed user interfaces                                          on PC system products.                                        The fundamental ideas of software engineering, discussed in the previous section,                                   apply to web-based software in  the same way that they apply to other types of  soft-                                   ware system. Experience gained with large system development in  the 20th century                                   is still  relevant to web-based software.                       1.2 Software                 engineering               ethics                                   Like  other  engineering  disciplines,   software  engineering  is carried  out  within   a                                   social and legal framework that limits  the freedom of people working in that area. As                                   a software engineer, you  must accept that  your job  involves  wider responsibilities                                   than simply  the application  of  technical skills.  You  must also behave in an ethical                                   and morally responsible way if  you are to be respected as a professional engineer.                                        It goes without  saying that  you should  uphold normal  standards of honesty and                                   integrity. You should not use your skills  and abilities to behave in a dishonest way or                                   in a way  that will  bring  disrepute to the software engineering  profession. However,                                   there are areas where standards of acceptable behavior are not bound by laws but by                                   the more tenuous notion of professional responsibility.  Some of these are:                                   1. Confidentiality You     should normally  respect the confidentiality of  your employ-                                          ers or clients  irrespective of whether  or not a formal  confidentiality   agreement                                          has been signed.                                   2. Competence You   should not misrepresent your level of competence. You should                                          not knowingly  accept work that is outside your  competence.                                   3. Intellectual     property rights You  should be aware of local laws governing the use                                          of intellectual  property  such as patents and copyright. You should be careful to                                          ensure that the intellectual property of  employers and clients is protected.                                   4. Computer     misuse You  should  not  use your  technical  skills   to  misuse other                                          people’s computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing                                          on an employer’s machine, say) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses or                                          other malware).32                                                                                                      1.2 \\x02 Software    engineering  ethics 15    Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice    ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices    PREAMBLE    The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are    included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as    software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious;    without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the    details form a cohesive code.         Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development,    testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their    commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following    Eight Principles:    1. PUBLIC   — Software  engineers   shall    act   consistently      with    the  public    interest.    2. CLIENT   AND EMPLOYER — Software engineers shall   act   in   a  manner that   is    in   the          best   interests     of   their     client     and employer   consistent     with   the   public    interest.    3. PRODUCT — Software engineers   shall    ensure   that    their    products   and  related          modifications      meet  the  highest    professional      standards   possible.    4. JUDGMENT — Software engineers   shall    maintain    integrity      and  independence  in   their          professional      judgment.    5. MANAGEMENT — Software engineering  managers and  leaders   shall     subscribe   to   and          promote  an  ethical     approach  to   the   management of  software   development   and          maintenance.    6. PROFESSION — Software engineers   shall    advance  the   integrity      and  reputation     of          the   profession    consistent     with   the   public    interest.    7. COLLEAGUES — Software engineers   shall    be fair     to   and supportive     of   their          colleagues.    8. SELF   — Software  engineers   shall     participate      in   lifelong      learning    regarding    the          practice     of   their    profession     and shall    promote  an  ethical     approach  to   the          practice     of   the  profession.                                       Professional  societies and institutions   have an important  role to  play  in settingFigure 1.3 TheACM/IEEE Code of    ethical standards. Organizations such as the ACM,  the IEEE  (Institute  of ElectricalEthics (© IEEE/ACM and  Electronic   Engineers),  and the  British   Computer  Society  publish  a code  of1999)                         professional  conduct or code of ethics. Members of these organizations undertake to                                   follow  that code when they sign up for membership. These codes of conduct are gen-                                   erally concerned with  fundamental ethical behavior.                                       Professional  associations, notably  the  ACM  and the IEEE,  have cooperated  to                                   produce a joint  code of ethics  and professional practice. This  code exists in both  a                                   short form, shown in Figure 1.3, and a longer form (Gotterbarn et al., 1999) that adds                                   detail and substance to the shorter version. The rationale behind this code is summa-                                   rized in the first  two paragraphs of the longer form:                                       Computers have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, government,                                       medicine, education, entertainment and society at large. Software engineers are                                       those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, spec-                                       ification,  design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software3316 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                        systems. Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engi-                                        neers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to                                        do good or  cause harm, or to  influence others to  do good or  cause harm. To                                        ensure, as much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software engi-                                        neers must commit themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and                                        respected profession. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers                                        shall adhere to the following Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.                                        The Code contains eight Principles  related  to the behaviour of  and decisions                                        made by professional software  engineers, including  practitioners,  educators,                                        managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well  as trainees and students of                                        the profession. The Principles  identify  the ethically  responsible relationships                                        in which  individuals,  groups, and  organizations  participate  and the primary                                        obligations within  these relationships. The Clauses of each Principle are illus-                                        trations of some of the obligations  included in these relationships. These obli-                                        gations are founded in the software engineer’s humanity, in special care owed                                        to people affected by the work of software engineers, and the unique elements                                        of the practice of  software engineering. The Code prescribes these as obliga-                                        tions of anyone claiming to be or  aspiring to be a software engineer.                                        In any situation  where different  people  have different views  and objectives you                                   are likely to  be faced with ethical dilemmas. For example, if  you disagree, in princi-                                   ple, with  the policies  of more senior management in  the company, how should you                                   react? Clearly, this  depends on the particular individuals   and the nature of the  dis-                                   agreement. Is it best to argue a case for your position from within the organization or                                   to resign  in principle?  If  you  feel that  there are problems with  a software  project,                                   when do you reveal these to management? If you discuss these while they are just a                                   suspicion, you may  be overreacting to a situation; if  you  leave it too late, it  may be                                   impossible to resolve the difficulties.                                        Such ethical dilemmas face all of  us in our professional  lives and, fortunately, in                                   most cases they are either relatively minor or can be resolved without  too much dif-                                   ficulty.  Where they cannot be resolved, the engineer is faced with,  perhaps, another                                   problem.  The principled  action  may be to  resign from  their  job  but this may  well                                   affect others such as their partner or their children.                                        A particularly    difficult   situation   for  professional  engineers arises  when their                                   employer acts in  an unethical way.  Say a company is responsible  for developing  a                                   safety-critical  system and, because of  time pressure, falsifies  the safety  validation                                   records. Is  the engineer’s responsibility   to  maintain confidentiality    or to  alert the                                   customer or publicize, in  some way, that the delivered system may be unsafe?                                        The problem here is that there are no absolutes when it comes to safety. Although                                   the system may not have been validated according to predefined criteria, these crite-                                   ria may be too strict. The system may actually operate safely throughout its lifetime.                                   It is also the case that, even when properly validated, the system may fail  and cause                                   an accident. Early disclosure of problems may result in  damage to the employer and                                   other employees; failure to disclose problems may result in  damage to others.34                                                                                                       1.3 \\x02 Case   studies 17                You must make up your own mind in  these matters. The appropriate ethical posi-           tion here depends entirely on  the views of  the individuals  who are involved.  In this           case, the potential for damage, the extent of the damage, and the people affected by           the damage should influence the decision. If  the situation  is very dangerous, it may           be justified   to  publicize  it  using  the  national  press (say).  However,  you  should           always try to resolve the situation  while respecting the rights of  your employer.                Another ethical  issue is participation  in the development of  military  and nuclear           systems. Some people feel strongly about these issues and do not wish to participate in           any systems development associated with military systems. Others will work on mili-           tary systems but not on weapons systems. Yet others feel that national security is an           overriding principle and have no ethical objections to working on weapons systems.                In this situation,  it is  important that both  employers and employees should make           their views  known  to each other in  advance. Where an organization  is involved  in           military  or nuclear work, they should be able to specify that employees must be will-           ing to  accept any work assignment. Equally,  if  an employee is taken on and makes           clear that they do not wish to work  on such systems, employers should not put pres-           sure on them to do so at some later date.                The general  area of  ethics  and professional  responsibility    is becoming  more           important as software-intensive systems pervade every aspect of work and everyday           life.  It can be considered from a philosophical  standpoint where the basic principles           of ethics are considered and software engineering ethics are discussed with reference           to these basic principles. This is the approach taken by Laudon (1995) and to a lesser           extent by  Huff  and Martin   (1995). Johnson’s  text on computer  ethics (2001)  also           approaches the topic from a philosophical perspective.                However, I  find  that this  philosophical  approach is too  abstract and difficult   to           relate to everyday experience. I prefer the more concrete approach embodied in codes           of conduct and practice. I think  that ethics are best discussed in a software engineer-           ing context  and not as a subject in their  own right.  In  this book, therefore,  I do not           include abstract ethical discussions but, where appropriate,  include examples in the           exercises that can be the starting point for a group discussion on ethical issues.1.3 Case           studies           To illustrate   software  engineering  concepts, I  use examples from  three  different           types of systems throughout the book. The reason why I have not used a single case           study is that one of the key messages in this book is that software engineering prac-           tice depends on the type of systems being produced. I therefore choose an appropri-           ate example  when discussing  concepts such  as safety and  dependability,  system           modeling, reuse, etc.                The three types of systems that I use as case studies are:           1. An    embedded system This is a system where  the software controls  a hardware                  device and is  embedded in that  device. Issues in  embedded systems typically3518 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                          include physical size, responsiveness, power management, etc. The example of an                                          embedded system that I use is a software system to control a medical device.                                   2. An    information   system This is  a system whose primary  purpose is  to manage                                          and provide access to a database of information.  Issues in information  systems                                          include security, usability,  privacy, and maintaining  data integrity. The example                                          of an information  system that I use is a medical records system.                                   3. A    sensor-based data collection system This is a system whose primary  purpose                                          is to  collect data from  a set of sensors and process that data in some way. The                                          key requirements of  such systems are reliability,  even in hostile  environmental                                          conditions,  and maintainability.   The example  of a data collection   system that                                          I use is a wilderness weather station.                                        I introduce  each of  these systems in this chapter,  with  more information   about                                   each of them available on the Web.                      1.3.1 An      insulin    pump    control     system                                   An insulin  pump is a medical system that simulates the operation of the pancreas (an                                   internal organ). The software controlling   this system is an embedded system, which                                   collects information   from  a sensor and controls  a pump  that delivers  a controlled                                   dose of insulin to a user.                                        People who suffer from diabetes use the system. Diabetes is a relatively common                                   condition  where the human pancreas is unable to produce sufficient  quantities  of a                                   hormone called insulin.  Insulin  metabolises glucose (sugar) in  the blood.  The con-                                   ventional treatment of  diabetes involves regular injections of genetically  engineered                                   insulin. Diabetics  measure their blood sugar levels using an external meter and then                                   calculate the dose of insulin that they should inject.                                        The problem with  this treatment is that the level  of insulin  required does not just                                   depend on the blood glucose level  but also on the time  of the last  insulin injection.                                   This can lead to very low levels of blood glucose (if there is too much insulin) or very                                   high levels of blood  sugar (if there is too  little insulin).  Low  blood glucose is, in  the                                   short term, a more serious condition as it can result in temporary brain malfunctioning                                   and, ultimately, unconsciousness and death. In the long term, however, continual high                                   levels of blood glucose can lead to eye damage, kidney damage, and heart problems.                                        Current advances in developing miniaturized sensors have meant that it is now pos-                                   sible to develop automated insulin delivery systems. These systems monitor blood sugar                                   levels and deliver an appropriate dose of insulin when required. Insulin delivery systems                                   like this already exist for the treatment of hospital patients. In the future, it may be pos-                                   sible for many diabetics to have such systems permanently attached to their bodies.                                        A software-controlled    insulin   delivery  system might   work  by using  a micro-                                   sensor embedded in the patient to measure some blood parameter that is proportional                                   to the sugar level. This is then sent to the pump controller.  This controller  computes                                   the sugar level and  the amount of  insulin  that is needed. It  then sends signals to a                                   miniaturized  pump to deliver the insulin  via a permanently attached needle.36                                                                                                                               1.3 \\x02 Case   studies 19                                                                                          Insulin Reservoir                                                               Needle                                                                                                  Pump                          Clock                                                             Assembly                                                               Sensor                     Controller                      Alarm                                                                                   Display1              Display2Figure 1.4 Insulin                                                                Power Supplypump hardware                            Blood                Analyze Sensor             Blood                    Compute              Insulin                            Sensor                   Reading                    Sugar                     Insulin                  Log                                                                                                                          Insulin                                                                                                                            Dose                         Insulin           Control Insulin          Pump           Compute Pump                                                                                                                                           Log Dose                         Pump                  Pump                  Data               Commands                                        Figure  1.4 shows  the  hardware  components  and organization   of  the  insulinFigure 1.5 Activitymodel of the insulin pump.    To  understand the examples in  this  book, all  you  need to know  is that  thepump                          blood  sensor measures  the electrical   conductivity    of  the blood  under  different                                   conditions   and  that these  values  can be  related  to  the  blood  sugar  level.  The                                   insulin  pump delivers  one unit of  insulin  in response to a single  pulse from  a con-                                   troller.  Therefore,  to deliver  10 units  of  insulin,  the controller   sends 10 pulses to                                   the pump.  Figure  1.5 is  a UML   activity   model  that illustrates   how the  software                                   transforms  an input  blood  sugar level  to a  sequence of commands  that drive  the                                   insulin  pump.                                        Clearly, this  is a safety-critical  system. If  the  pump fails  to operate or  does not                                   operate correctly,  then the  user’s health  may be damaged or  they may  fall  into  a                                   coma because their blood sugar levels are too high or too  low. There are, therefore,                                   two essential high-level requirements that this system must meet:                                   1. The    system shall be available to deliver insulin  when required.                                   2. The    system shall  perform reliably  and deliver  the correct  amount of insulin  to                                          counteract the current level of blood  sugar.3720 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                                            MHC-PMS                 MHC-PMS                 MHC-PMS                                                               Local                          Local                          Local                                                                                         MHC-PMS ServerFigure 1.6 The                                                                 Patient Databaseorganization ofthe MHC-PMS                                        The system must therefore be designed and implemented to  ensure that the sys-                                   tem always meets these requirements. More  detailed requirements and discussions                                   of how to ensure that the system is safe are discussed in later chapters.                     1.3.2 A      patient     information       system    for   mental    health     care                                   A patient  information   system to support  mental health  care is a medical  informa-                                   tion  system  that  maintains   information    about  patients   suffering   from  mental                                   health problems  and  the treatments  that they  have received.  Most  mental  health                                   patients do  not require  dedicated  hospital  treatment but  need to attend  specialist                                   clinics  regularly   where  they  can meet a  doctor  who  has detailed  knowledge  of                                   their  problems. To  make it  easier for  patients to  attend, these clinics  are  not just                                   run in  hospitals.  They may  also be held in  local  medical  practices or  community                                   centers.                                        The MHC-PMS  (Mental Health Care-Patient Management System) is an informa-                                   tion system that is intended for use in clinics. It makes use of a centralized database of                                   patient information but has also been designed to run on a PC, so that it may be accessed                                   and used from sites that do not have secure network connectivity. When the local sys-                                   tems have secure network access, they use patient information in the database but they                                   can download and use local copies of patient records when they are disconnected. The                                   system is not a complete  medical records system so does not maintain  information                                   about other medical conditions. However, it may interact and exchange data with other                                   clinical information  systems. Figure 1.6 illustrates the organization of the MHC-PMS.                                        The MHC-PMS  has two overall goals:                                   1. To    generate management information   that  allows health  service  managers to                                          assess performance against local and government targets.                                   2. To    provide  medical  staff  with  timely  information   to support  the treatment  of                                          patients.38                                                                                            1.3 \\x02 Case   studies 21    The nature of  mental health problems is such that patients are often disorganizedso may miss appointments, deliberately or  accidentally lose prescriptions  and med-ication, forget instructions,  and make unreasonable demands on medical staff. Theymay drop in on clinics  unexpectedly. In a minority  of cases, they may be a danger tothemselves or to other people. They may regularly change address or may be home-less on a long-term or short-term basis. Where patients are dangerous, they may needto be ‘sectioned’—confined  to a secure hospital for treatment and observation.    Users of the system include clinical  staff  such as doctors, nurses, and health visi-tors (nurses who visit people at home to check on their treatment). Nonmedical usersinclude receptionists  who make appointments,  medical records staff  who maintainthe records system, and administrative staff who generate reports.    The system is used to record information about patients (name, address, age, nextof kin,  etc.), consultations (date, doctor  seen, subjective impressions of the patient,etc.), conditions, and treatments. Reports are generated at regular intervals for med-ical staff and health authority managers. Typically, reports for medical  staff focus oninformation  about individual  patients whereas management reports are anonymizedand are concerned with conditions, costs of treatment, etc.    The key features of the system are:1. Individual     care management Clinicians  can create records for patients, edit the       information  in  the system, view  patient history,  etc. The system supports data       summaries so that doctors  who have not previously  met  a patient can quickly       learn about the key problems and treatments that have been prescribed.2. Patient    monitoring The   system regularly  monitors  the records of  patients that       are involved in treatment and issues warnings if possible problems are detected.       Therefore, if  a patient has not  seen a doctor for some time,  a warning  may be       issued. One of the most important elements of the monitoring  system is to keep       track of patients who have been sectioned and to ensure that the legally required       checks are carried out at the right time.3. Administrative     reporting The   system generates monthly  management  reports       showing the  number of  patients treated at each clinic,   the number of  patients       who have entered and  left  the care system, number  of patients  sectioned, the       drugs prescribed and their costs, etc.    Two different  laws affect the system. These are laws on data protection that governthe confidentiality of personal information and mental health laws that govern the com-pulsory detention of patients deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. Mentalhealth is unique in this respect as it is the only medical speciality that can recommendthe detention of patients against their will. This is subject to very strict legislative safe-guards. One of the aims of the MHC-PMS  is to ensure that staff always act in accor-dance with the law and that their decisions are recorded for judicial review if necessary.    As in all  medical systems, privacy is a critical system requirement. It is essential thatpatient information is confidential and is never disclosed to anyone apart from author-ized medical staff and the patient themselves. The MHC-PMS is also a safety-critical3922 Chapter    1 \\x02 Introduction                                                                      «system»                                   «system»                                                                 Weather Station                       Data Management                                                                                                                      and Archiving                                                                      «system»Figure 1.7 The weather                         Station Maintenancestation’s environment                                   system. Some mental illnesses cause patients to become suicidal or a danger to other                                   people. Wherever possible, the system should warn medical staff about potentially sui-                                   cidal or dangerous patients.                                        The overall  design  of  the system  has to take  into  account privacy   and safety                                   requirements. The system must be available  when needed otherwise safety may be                                   compromised and it may be impossible to prescribe the correct medication to patients.                                   There is a potential conflict  here—privacy is easiest to maintain when there is only a                                   single copy of the system data. However, to ensure availability in  the event of server                                   failure or  when disconnected from a network,  multiple  copies of the data should be                                   maintained. I discuss the trade-offs between these requirements in later chapters.                     1.3.3 A      wilderness      weather     station                                   To help monitor climate  change and to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts in                                   remote areas, the government of a country with  large areas of wilderness decides to                                   deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas. These weather stations col-                                   lect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine,                                   rainfall,  wind speed, and wind direction.                                        Wilderness weather stations are part of  a larger system  (Figure 1.7),  which is  a                                   weather information   system that collects  data from  weather stations  and makes it                                   available to other systems for processing. The systems in Figure 1.7 are:                                   1. The    weather  station  system This  is  responsible  for  collecting   weather data,                                          carrying out some initial  data processing, and transmitting it to the data manage-                                          ment system.                                   2. The    data management and archiving system This system collects the data from                                          all of  the wilderness weather stations, carries out  data processing and analysis,                                          and archives the data in a form  that can be retrieved by  other systems, such as                                          weather forecasting systems.                                   3. The    station   maintenance  system This  system can  communicate  by  satellite                                          with  all wilderness  weather stations to monitor  the health of these systems and                                          provide  reports  of  problems.  It  can update  the embedded  software  in these                                          systems.  In the  event of  system  problems,  this  system  can also  be used to                                          remotely  control  a wilderness weather system.40                                                                                            1.3 \\x02 Case   studies 23    In  Figure 1.7, I have used the UML  package symbol to indicate that  each systemis a collection  of  components and  have identified  the separate systems, using  theUML  stereotype «system». The associations between the packages indicate there isan exchange of information but,  at this stage, there is no need to define them in anymore detail.    Each  weather station  includes  a number  of  instruments  that measure weatherparameters such as the wind speed and direction, the  ground and air  temperatures,the barometric pressure, and the rainfall over a 24-hour period. Each of these instru-ments is controlled by  a software system that takes parameter readings periodicallyand manages the data collected from the instruments.    The  weather station system  operates by collecting  weather observations  at fre-quent intervals—for  example,  temperatures are measured every minute.  However,because the bandwidth to the satellite is relatively narrow, the weather station carriesout some local processing and aggregation of  the data. It then transmits this  aggre-gated data when requested by the data collection system. If, for whatever reason, it isimpossible to make a connection, then the weather station maintains the data locallyuntil communication  can be resumed.    Each weather station is battery-powered and must be entirely self-contained—thereare no external power or network cables available. All communications are through a rel-atively slow-speed satellite link and the weather station must include some mechanism(solar or wind power) to charge its batteries. As they are deployed in wilderness areas,they are exposed to severe environmental conditions and may be damaged by animals.The station software is therefore not just concerned with data collection. It must also:1. Monitor     the instruments, power, and communication hardware and report faults       to the management system.2.

Contents           2.1 Software process models           2.2 Process activities           2.3 Coping with change           2.4 The Rational Unified Process4528 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                   A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of  a soft-                                   ware product. These activities may involve the development of software from scratch                                   in a standard programming language like  Java or C. However, business applications                                   are not necessarily developed in this way. New business software is now often devel-                                   oped by extending and modifying existing  systems or by configuring and integrating                                   off-the-shelf  software or system components.                                        There are many different  software processes but all  must include  four activities                                   that are fundamental to software engineering:                                   1. Software    specification The  functionality   of  the software and constraints  on its                                          operation must be defined.                                   2. Software     design and  implementation The   software  to meet  the specification                                          must be produced.                                   3. Software    validation The  software  must be validated to ensure that it  does what                                          the customer wants.                                   4. Software    evolution The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.                                        In some form,  these activities  are part of  all  software processes. In practice,  of                                   course, they are complex activities  in themselves and include sub-activities  such as                                   requirements validation, architectural design, unit testing, etc. There are also support-                                   ing process activities such as documentation and software configuration management.                                        When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk  about the activities  in                                   these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc., and                                   the ordering of  these activities. However,  as well as activities,  process descriptions                                   may also include:                                   1. Products,    which  are the outcomes of  a process activity.  For example,  the out-                                          come of  the activity   of  architectural  design  may be a model  of  the software                                          architecture.                                   2. Roles,    which  reflect  the responsibilities  of  the people involved  in the process.                                          Examples of roles are project manager, configuration manager, programmer, etc.                                   3. Pre-    and post-conditions,  which  are statements that are true before and after a                                          process activity  has been enacted or a product  produced. For example, before                                          architectural  design begins, a pre-condition  may be that  all requirements  have                                          been approved by the customer;  after this activity   is finished, a  post-condition                                          might be that the UML  models describing  the architecture have been reviewed.                                        Software processes are complex and, like all  intellectual  and creative processes,                                   rely on people making  decisions and judgments. There is no ideal process and most                                   organizations have developed their own software development processes. Processes                                   have evolved to take advantage of  the capabilities of  the people in  an organization                                   and the specific  characteristics of  the systems that are being  developed. For some46                                                                                   2.1 \\x02 Software    process models 29           systems, such as critical systems, a very structured development process is required.           For business systems, with  rapidly   changing requirements,  a less formal,  flexible           process is likely to  be more effective.                Sometimes,  software  processes are categorized  as either plan-driven   or  agile           processes. Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are           planned in  advance and progress is measured against this plan. In  agile  processes,           which  I discuss in  Chapter 3, planning is  incremental and it  is easier to change the           process to reflect  changing  customer requirements.  As Boehm  and Turner (2003)           discuss, each approach is  suitable  for  different  types of  software.  Generally,  you           need to find a balance between plan-driven and agile processes.                Although  there is  no ‘ideal’   software process, there is  scope for improving   the           software process in many organizations. Processes may include outdated techniques           or may  not take  advantage of the best practice  in  industrial  software engineering.           Indeed,  many organizations   still  do  not take  advantage of  software  engineering           methods in their software development.                Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diver-           sity in  software processes across an organization is reduced. This leads to improved           communication  and a reduction in training  time, and makes automated process sup-           port more economical.  Standardization is also an important  first step in  introducing           new software  engineering methods and techniques  and good software engineering           practice. I discuss software process improvement in more detail in  Chapter 26.2.1 Software                process          models           As I  explained in Chapter 1, a software process model is a simplified  representation           of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular per-           spective, and thus provides only partial information  about that process. For example,           a process activity  model shows the activities  and their  sequence but may not show           the roles of the people involved in these activities. In  this section, I introduce a num-           ber of  very  general process  models (sometimes  called  ‘process paradigms’)   and           present these from an architectural perspective. That is, we see the framework of the           process but not the details of specific activities.                These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes. Rather,           they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to           software  development. You can think  of  them as process frameworks  that may  be           extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.                The process models that I cover here are:           1. The    waterfall  model This  takes the fundamental process activities of  specifica-                  tion,  development,  validation,  and evolution   and represents them as separate                  process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implemen-                  tation, testing,  and so on.4730 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                         Requirements                                           Definition                                                                    System and                                                                 Software Design                                                                                           Implementation                                                                                          and Unit Testing                                                                                                                     Integration and                                                                                                                     System Testing                                                                                                                                              Operation andFigure 2.1 The                                                                                                                        Maintenancewaterfall model                                   2. Incremental     development This approach interleaves the  activities of  specifica-                                          tion, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions                                          (increments), with each version adding functionality  to the previous version.                                   3. Reuse-oriented   software engineering This  approach is based on the existence of                                          a significant  number of reusable components. The system development process                                          focuses on integrating  these components into  a system rather than developing                                          them from scratch.                                       These models are not  mutually  exclusive and are often used together, especially                                   for large systems development. For large  systems, it makes sense to combine some                                   of the  best features of the waterfall  and the incremental  development models.  You                                   need to have information  about the essential system requirements to  design a soft-                                   ware architecture to support these requirements. You cannot develop this incremen-                                   tally.   Sub-systems  within   a  larger   system  may  be  developed  using   different                                   approaches. Parts of the system that are well understood can be specified and devel-                                   oped using  a waterfall-based   process. Parts of  the system  which  are difficult    to                                   specify in  advance, such as the user interface, should always be developed using an                                   incremental approach.                      2.1.1 The      waterfall      model                                   The first  published  model of  the software  development process was derived  from                                   more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated                                   in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known                                   as the ‘waterfall model’  or software life  cycle. The waterfall  model is an example of                                   a plan-driven process—in  principle,  you must  plan and schedule all  of the process                                   activities before starting work  on them.48                                                                       2.1 \\x02 Software    process models 31    The principal  stages of the waterfall model directly reflect  the fundamental devel-opment activities:1. Requirements    analysis  and definition The   system’s services,  constraints, and       goals are established by consultation with  system users. They are then defined       in detail and serve as a system specification.2. System   and software  design The systems design process allocates the require-       ments to either hardware or software systems by establishing an overall  system       architecture. Software design involves identifying  and describing the fundamen-       tal software system abstractions and their relationships.3. Implementation    and  unit testing During   this stage, the software design is  real-       ized as a set of programs or program  units. Unit  testing involves verifying   that       each unit meets its specification.4. Integration      and  system testing The    individual   program   units  or  programs       are integrated  and tested  as a complete   system to  ensure that  the  software       requirements have been met. After  testing, the software  system is delivered  to       the customer.5. Operation     and maintenance Normally    (although  not  necessarily),  this is  the       longest  life  cycle  phase. The  system is  installed  and put  into  practical  use.       Maintenance  involves correcting   errors which  were  not discovered  in earlier       stages of  the life  cycle,  improving    the implementation   of  system  units and       enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.    In  principle,  the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved(‘signed off’).   The following  phase should not start until the previous phase has fin-ished. In practice,  these stages overlap and feed information  to each other. Duringdesign, problems with  requirements are identified. During  coding,  design problemsare found and so on. The software process is not a simple linear model but  involvesfeedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in  each phase may thenhave to be modified to reflect the changes made.    Because of  the costs of  producing  and approving  documents, iterations  can becostly and involve significant  rework.  Therefore, after a small  number of iterations,it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to con-tinue  with  the  later  development  stages. Problems  are  left  for  later  resolution,ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of requirements may meanthat the system won’t  do what  the user wants. It  may also lead to  badly structuredsystems as design problems are circumvented by implementation tricks.    During  the final  life  cycle phase (operation and maintenance) the software is putinto use. Errors and omissions in the original  software requirements are discovered.Program and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality   is identified.The system must therefore evolve to remain useful. Making these changes (softwaremaintenance) may involve repeating previous process stages.4932 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                   Cleanroom software engineering     An example of a formal development process, originally developed by IBM, is the Cleanroom process. In the     Cleanroom process each software increment is formally specified and this specification is transformed into an     implementation. Software correctness is demonstrated using a formal approach. There is no unit testing for     defects in the process and the system testing is focused on assessing the system’s reliability.        The objective of the Cleanroom process is zero-defects software so that delivered systems have a high level     of reliability.                                         http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Cleanroom/                                       The waterfall  model is consistent with other engineering process models and docu-                                   mentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can                                   monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible par-                                   titioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage                                   in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.                                       In  principle,  the waterfall  model should only  be used when the requirements are                                   well  understood  and  unlikely   to  change  radically   during  system  development.                                   However, the waterfall  model reflects the type  of process used in other engineering                                   projects. As  is easier to  use a common management model  for  the whole  project,                                   software processes based on the waterfall model are still commonly used.                                       An  important variant of  the waterfall model is formal  system development, where                                   a mathematical   model  of  a system  specification   is created.  This  model  is  then                                   refined, using mathematical  transformations that  preserve its consistency, into exe-                                   cutable code. Based on the assumption that your  mathematical transformations  are                                   correct, you can therefore make a strong  argument that a program generated in this                                   way is consistent with its  specification.                                       Formal  development processes, such as that based on the B method (Schneider,                                   2001; Wordsworth, 1996)  are particularly  suited to the development of systems that                                   have stringent safety, reliability, or  security requirements. The formal approach sim-                                   plifies the production  of a safety or security case. This demonstrates to customers or                                   regulators that the system actually meets its safety or security requirements.                                       Processes based on formal transformations are generally  only used in  the devel-                                   opment  of  safety-critical   or  security-critical    systems.  They  require  specialized                                   expertise. For the  majority  of  systems this process does not offer  significant  cost-                                   benefits over other approaches to system development.                     2.1.2 Incremental           development                                   Incremental development is  based on the idea of developing an initial   implementa-                                   tion, exposing this to user comment and evolving it  through several versions until an                                   adequate system has been developed (Figure 2.2).

Incremental    software   development,   which   is  a  fundamental   part   of  agile                                   approaches, is better than a waterfall approach for most  business, e-commerce, and                                   personal systems. Incremental   development reflects  the  way that  we solve  prob-                                   lems. We rarely work  out a complete problem solution  in advance but move toward                                   a solution  in a series of  steps, backtracking  when we realize  that we have made a                                   mistake. By developing  the software incrementally,  it is cheaper and easier to make                                   changes in the software as it is being developed.                                       Each  increment or  version of  the system incorporates some of  the functionality                                   that is needed by the customer. Generally, the early increments of the system include                                   the most  important  or  most urgently   required  functionality.   This  means that  the                                   customer can evaluate the system at a relatively early stage in the development to see                                   if  it  delivers  what  is required.  If   not, then  only  the current  increment   has to be                                   changed and, possibly, new functionality defined  for later increments.                                       Incremental  development has three important benefits, compared to the waterfall                                   model:                                   1. The    cost  of accommodating  changing customer  requirements is reduced.  The                                          amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than is                                          required with  the waterfall model.                                   2. It     is easier to  get customer feedback  on the development  work  that  has been                                          done. Customers can comment on demonstrations of  the software and see how                                          much has been implemented. Customers find it  difficult  to judge progress from                                          software design documents.                                   3. More    rapid delivery  and deployment of useful software to the customer is possi-                                          ble, even if all  of the functionality  has not been included. Customers are able to                                          use and gain value  from  the software  earlier than is  possible with  a waterfall                                          process.5134 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                   Problems with incremental development     Although incremental development has many advantages, it is not problem-free. The primary cause of the     difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there     may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.        Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons—for example, there may be procedures to ensure     that the software properly implements external regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley     accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible so process conflicts may be     unavoidable.                                     http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/IncrementalDev/                                        Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the                                   development of application  systems. This approach can be either plan-driven, agile,                                   or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. In a plan-driven approach, the system                                   increments are identified in advance; if an agile approach is adopted, the early incre-                                   ments are identified but the development of later increments depends on progress and                                   customer priorities.                                        From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:                                   1. The     process is  not visible.   Managers  need regular  deliverables   to measure                                          progress. If  systems are developed quickly,  it  is  not cost-effective  to produce                                          documents that reflect every version of the system.                                   2. System    structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Unless time and                                          money is spent on refactoring  to improve  the software, regular change tends to                                          corrupt  its structure. Incorporating   further software  changes becomes increas-                                          ingly  difficult  and costly.                                        The problems of  incremental  development become particularly   acute for  large,                                   complex, long-lifetime  systems, where different  teams develop different parts of the                                   system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture and the responsibili-                                   ties of the different  teams working on parts of  the system need to be clearly defined                                   with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather than devel-                                   oped incrementally.                                        You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment,                                   without   actually  delivering   it  and  deploying   it  in   the customer’s   environment.                                   Incremental delivery and deployment  means that the software is used in real, opera-                                   tional processes. This is not always possible as experimenting with new software can                                   disrupt normal business processes.

This often happens                                   informally   when people  working  on the  project  know of  designs or  code that are                                   similar  to what is required. They  look for  these, modify  them as needed, and incor-                                   porate them into their system.                                       This  informal   reuse takes place irrespective of  the development  process that is                                   used. However, in the 21st century, software development processes that focus on the                                   reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely                                   on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating  framework  for                                   the composition of  these components. Sometimes, these components are systems in                                   their own  right (COTS  or commercial  off-the-shelf  systems) that may provide  spe-                                   cific  functionality  such as word processing or a spreadsheet.                                       A  general  process model for  reuse-based development is shown  in  Figure 2.3.                                   Although  the  initial  requirements  specification  stage and the  validation  stage are                                   comparable  with   other  software  processes, the  intermediate   stages in  a reuse-                                   oriented process are different. These stages are:                                   1. Component    analysis Given the requirements specification,  a search is made for                                          components to implement that specification. Usually, there is no exact match and                                          the components that may be used only provide some of the functionality required.                                   2. Requirements   modification During this stage, the requirements are analyzed using                                          information about the components that have been discovered. They are then mod-                                          ified to reflect the available components. Where modifications are impossible, the                                          component analysis activity may be re-entered to search for alternative solutions.                                   3. System    design with  reuse During  this  phase, the framework   of the  system is                                          designed or an existing framework is reused. The designers take into account the                                          components that are reused and organize the framework to cater for this.  Some                                          new software may have to be designed if reusable components are not available.                                   4. Development     and integration Software    that cannot be  externally  procured  is                                          developed, and the components and COTS systems are integrated to create the                                          new system. System integration, in  this model, may be part of  the development                                          process rather than a separate activity.5336 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                        There are three types of software component that may be used in a reuse-oriented                                   process:                                   1. Web    services that are developed according  to service standards and which  are                                          available for remote invocation.                                   2. Collections     of  objects that are developed as a package to be integrated  with  a                                          component framework such as .NET or J2EE.                                   3. Stand-alone      software  systems  that  are  configured   for  use  in  a  particular                                          environment.                                        Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious  advantage of reducing the                                   amount of  software to be developed and so reducing  cost and risks. It  usually  also                                   leads to faster  delivery  of  the software.  However, requirements  compromises  are                                   inevitable and this  may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users.                                   Furthermore, some control  over the system evolution  is lost as new versions of  the                                   reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them.                                        Software reuse is very important and I have dedicated several chapters in the third                                   part of the book  to this topic.  General issues of software reuse and COTS reuse are                                   covered in Chapter  16, component-based software engineering in  Chapters 17 and                                   18, and service-oriented systems in Chapter 19.                       2.2 Process               activities                                   Real software  processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative,  and                                   managerial activities  with  the overall  goal of  specifying,  designing, implementing,                                   and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software                                   tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for  supporting the editing of different                                   types of document  and for  managing the immense volume  of detailed  information                                   that is generated in a large software project.                                        The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evo-                                   lution  are organized differently  in different  development processes. In the waterfall                                   model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are                                   interleaved. How  these activities  are carried  out depends on the  type of  software,                                   people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example,                                   specifications  are written  on cards. Tests are executable and developed before  the                                   program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.                     2.2.1 Software          specification                                   Software specification  or requirements engineering  is the process of understanding                                   and defining  what  services are required  from  the system and identifying   the con-                                   straints on the system’s operation  and development. Requirements engineering is a54                                                                                                                                 2.2 \\x02 Process       activities 37                Software  development  toolsSoftware development tools (sometimes  called Computer-Aided Software Engineering or CASE tools) areprograms that are used to support  software engineering process activities. These tools therefore include designeditors, data dictionaries, compilers, debuggers, system building tools, etc.    Software tools provide process support by automating  some process activities and by providing informationabout the software that  is being developed. Examples of activities that can be automated include:\\x02 The development of graphical system models as part of the requirements specification or the software design\\x02 The generation of  code from these graphical models\\x02 The generation of user interfaces from a graphical interface description that is created interactively by the user\\x02 Program debugging  through the provision  of information  about an executing program\\x02 The automated  translation of programs written  using an old version of a programming  language to a more    recent version    Tools may be combined within  a framework called an Interactive Development Environment  or IDE. Thisprovides a common set of facilities that  tools can use so that it is easier for tools to communicate  and operatein an integrated way. The ECLIPSE IDE is widely used and has been designed to incorporate many differenttypes of software tools.                                              http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/CASE/                                  particularly     critical    stage  of  the  software    process  as  errors  at  this  stage   inevitably                                  lead to  later  problems   in  the  system  design  and  implementation.                                       The  requirements     engineering    process   (Figure    2.4)  aims   to  produce   an  agreed                                  requirements   document    that  specifies   a system  satisfying    stakeholder   requirements.                                  Requirements   are  usually   presented  at  two  levels  of  detail.   End-users  and  customers                                  need  a high-level     statement   of   the  requirements;     system   developers   need   a more                                  detailed  system   specification.                                       There  are  four  main  activities    in  the requirements    engineering   process:                                  1. Feasibility       study An   estimate  is  made of  whether  the  identified   user needs  may  be                                          satisfied  using   current  software   and  hardware   technologies.   The  study  considers                                          whether  the  proposed  system  will   be cost-effective    from   a business point   of  view                                          and  if  it  can  be  developed   within    existing    budgetary   constraints.    A  feasibility                                          study  should  be relatively    cheap and  quick.  The  result  should  inform   the  decision                                          of  whether  or  not  to go  ahead with   a more  detailed  analysis.                                  2. Requirements       elicitation    and  analysis This    is  the process  of  deriving    the system                                          requirements    through   observation    of  existing   systems,   discussions   with   poten-                                          tial  users  and procurers,   task  analysis,   and so  on. This   may  involve   the develop-                                          ment  of  one or  more  system   models  and  prototypes.   These  help  you  understand                                          the system   to be  specified.                                  3. Requirements       specification Requirements        specification     is the  activity    of  trans-                                          lating  the  information     gathered  during   the analysis   activity   into   a document   that5538 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                            Feasibility               Requirements                                               Study                   Elicitation and                                                                                Analysis                                                                                                            Requirements                                                                                                             Specification                                            Feasibility                                                                                Requirements                                              Report                                                                                      Validation                                                                                System                                                                                Models                                                                                                          User and System                                                                                                            RequirementsFigure 2.4 The                                                                                                                     Requirementsrequirements                                                                                                                          Documentengineering process                                          defines a set of requirements. Two types of requirements may be included in this                                          document.  User requirements  are abstract  statements of  the system  require-                                          ments for  the customer and end-user of the system; system requirements are a                                          more detailed description of  the functionality  to be provided.                                   4. Requirements   validation This activity  checks the requirements for realism, consis-                                          tency, and completeness. During this process, errors in the requirements document                                          are inevitably discovered. It must then be modified to correct these problems.                                        Of course, the activities in the requirements process are not simply carried out in a                                   strict sequence. Requirements analysis continues during definition and specification and                                   new requirements come to light  throughout  the process. Therefore, the activities  of                                   analysis, definition, and specification are interleaved. In agile methods, such as extreme                                   programming, requirements are developed incrementally according to user priorities and                                   the elicitation of requirements comes from users who are part of the development team.                    2.2.2 Software           design    and   implementation                                   The implementation  stage of  software development  is the  process of converting  a                                   system specification into an executable system. It always involves processes of soft-                                   ware design and  programming  but, if  an  incremental approach  to development  is                                   used, may also involve refinement of the software specification.                                        A software design is a description of the structure of the software to be implemented,                                   the data models and structures used by the system, the interfaces between system com-                                   ponents and, sometimes, the algorithms used. Designers do  not arrive at a finished                                   design immediately but develop the design iteratively. They add formality and detail as                                   they develop their design with constant backtracking to correct earlier designs.                                        Figure 2.5 is  an abstract model of  this process showing the inputs  to the design                                   process, process activities, and the documents produced as outputs from this process.56                                                                                                                       2.2 \\x02 Process    activities 39                                                                                                                                            Design Inputs                                                                   Platform           Requirements             Data                                                                 Information          Specification         Description                                                                                                                                         Design Activities                                                                 Architectural           Interface            Component                                                                     Design                 Design                 Design                                                                                          Database Design                                                                                                                                          Design Outputs                                                      System               Database             Interface            ComponentFigure 2.5 A general                  Architecture         Specification        Specification        Specificationmodel of the designprocess                                   The diagram  suggests that the stages of the design process are sequential. In  fact,                                   design process activities  are interleaved.  Feedback from  one stage to another and                                   consequent design rework is inevitable in all  design processes.                                       Most  software interfaces with other software systems. These include the operating                                   system, database, middleware, and other application systems. These make up the ‘soft-                                   ware platform’, the environment in which the software will execute. Information about                                   this platform is an essential input to the design process, as designers must decide how                                   best to integrate it with the software’s environment. The requirements specification is a                                   description of  the functionality   the software must provide  and its  performance and                                   dependability requirements. If the system is to process existing data, then the description                                   of that data may be included in the platform specification; otherwise, the data description                                   must be an input to the design process so that the system data organization to be defined.                                       The  activities in  the design process vary, depending on the type of system being                                   developed.  For  example,  real-time  systems  require  timing   design  but  may  not                                   include a  database so there is no database design involved. Figure  2.5 shows four                                   activities that may be part of the design process for information  systems:                                   1. Architectural     design, where you identify  the overall structure  of the system, the                                          principal  components  (sometimes called  sub-systems or modules),  their rela-                                          tionships, and how they are distributed.                                   2. Interface    design, where  you define the interfaces between system components.                                          This  interface specification  must  be unambiguous. With  a precise interface,  a                                          component  can be used without   other components  having to  know  how it  is                                          implemented. Once interface  specifications are agreed, the components can be                                          designed and developed concurrently.5740 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                   Structured methods     Structured methods are an approach to software design in which graphical models that should be developed as     part of the design process are defined. The method may also define a process for developing the models and rules     that apply to each model type. Structured methods lead to standardized documentation for a system and are     particularly useful in providing a development framework for less-experienced and less-expert software developers.                                  http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Structured-methods/                                   3. Component   design, where you take each system component and design how it will                                          operate. This  may  be a simple  statement of  the  expected functionality   to  be                                          implemented, with the specific design left to the programmer. Alternatively, it may                                          be a list of changes to be made to a reusable component or a detailed design model.                                          The design model may be used to automatically generate an implementation.                                   4. Database    design, where you design the system data structures and how these are                                          to be represented in  a database. Again, the work  here depends on whether  an                                          existing database is to be reused or a new database is to be created.                                        These activities lead to a set of design outputs, which are also shown in Figure 2.5.                                   The detail and representation of these vary considerably. For critical systems, detailed                                   design documents setting out precise and accurate descriptions of the system must be                                   produced. If a model-driven approach is used, these outputs may mostly be diagrams.                                   Where agile methods of development are used, the outputs of the design process may not                                   be separate specification documents but may be represented in the code of the program.                                        Structured methods for design were developed in  the 1970s and 1980s and were                                   the precursor to the UML   and object-oriented design (Budgen, 2003). They  rely on                                   producing graphical models of the system and, in many cases, automatically generat-                                   ing code  from  these models. Model-driven   development (MDD)   or  model-driven                                   engineering (Schmidt,  2006), where models of  the software are created at different                                   levels of abstraction, is an evolution of  structured methods. In MDD,  there is greater                                   emphasis on architectural models with a separation between abstract implementation-                                   independent models and implementation-specific models. The models are developed                                   in sufficient detail so that the executable system can be generated from them. I discuss                                   this approach to development in Chapter 5.                                        The development of a program to implement the system follows naturally from the                                   system design processes. Although some classes of program, such as safety-critical                                   systems, are usually designed in detail before any implementation begins, it  is more                                   common for  the later stages of design and program  development to be interleaved.                                   Software  development tools  may  be used to generate a  skeleton program  from  a                                   design. This includes code to define and implement interfaces, and, in many cases, the                                   developer need only add details of the operation of each program component.                                        Programming is a personal activity and there is no general process that is usually                                   followed.  Some programmers start with  components that  they understand, develop                                   these, and then move on  to less-understood components. Others  take the opposite58                                                                                                                       2.2 \\x02 Process    activities 41                                                            Component                                                Acceptance                                                                                           System Testing                                                               Testing                                                       TestingFigure 2.6 Stagesof testing                                   approach, leaving familiar   components till  last because they know  how to develop                                   them. Some developers like to define data early in  the process then use this to drive                                   the program development; others leave data unspecified for as long as possible.                                       Normally,  programmers carry out some testing of the code they have developed. This                                   often reveals program defects that must be removed from the program. This is called                                   debugging. Defect testing and debugging are different processes. Testing establishes the                                   existence of defects. Debugging is concerned with locating and correcting these defects.                                       When  you are debugging, you  have to generate hypotheses about the observable                                   behavior of the program then test these hypotheses in the hope of finding the fault that                                   caused the output anomaly. Testing the hypotheses may involve tracing the program                                   code manually.  It  may require  new test cases to localize  the  problem.  Interactive                                   debugging tools, which show the intermediate values of program variables and a trace                                   of the statements executed, may be used to support the debugging process.                    2.2.3 Software           validation                                   Software  validation    or,  more  generally,   verification   and  validation    (V&V)    is                                   intended to show that  a system both conforms  to its specification  and that it  meets                                   the expectations of the system customer. Program testing, where the  system is exe-                                   cuted using simulated test data, is the principal validation technique. Validation  may                                   also involve checking processes, such as inspections and reviews, at each stage of the                                   software  process  from   user  requirements  definition    to  program  development.                                   Because of the predominance of testing, the majority of validation  costs are incurred                                   during and after implementation.                                       Except  for small  programs, systems should not be tested as a single, monolithic                                   unit. Figure 2.6 shows a three-stage testing process in which system components are                                   tested then the integrated system is tested and, finally, the system is  tested with the                                   customer’s data. Ideally, component defects are discovered early in the process, and                                   interface problems are found when the system is integrated. However, as defects are                                   discovered, the program must be debugged and this may require other  stages in the                                   testing process to be repeated. Errors in program components, say, may come to light                                   during  system testing.  The process is  therefore an iterative   one with  information                                   being fed back from later  stages to earlier parts of the process.                                       The  stages in the testing process are:                                   1. Development    testing The  components making  up the system are tested by  the                                          people developing the system. Each component is tested independently, without                                          other system components. Components may be simple entities such as functions5942 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                          or object  classes, or may be coherent groupings of these entities. Test automa-                                          tion tools,  such as JUnit (Massol and Husted, 2003), that can re-run component                                          tests when new versions of the component are created, are commonly used.                                   2. System   testing System  components are integrated to create a complete system.                                          This  process is concerned  with  finding   errors that  result from   unanticipated                                          interactions between components and component interface  problems. It  is also                                          concerned with showing that the system meets its functional and non-functional                                          requirements,  and testing the  emergent system properties.  For large  systems,                                          this may be a multi-stage process where components are integrated to form sub-                                          systems that are  individually   tested before  these sub-systems are themselves                                          integrated to form  the final system.                                   3. Acceptance   testing This is the final  stage in the testing process before the system                                          is accepted for  operational use. The system is tested with  data supplied by  the                                          system customer rather than with   simulated test data. Acceptance testing  may                                          reveal errors and omissions in  the system requirements definition,  because the                                          real data exercise the system in  different  ways from  the test  data. Acceptance                                          testing may also reveal requirements problems  where the system’s facilities  do                                          not really  meet the user’s needs or the system performance is unacceptable.                                        Normally,   component   development   and  testing   processes  are  interleaved.                                   Programmers make up  their own  test data and incrementally   test the code as it  is                                   developed. This is an economically sensible approach, as the programmer knows the                                   component and is therefore the best person to generate test cases.                                        If  an incremental  approach to  development is  used, each increment  should be                                   tested as it is developed, with  these tests based on the requirements for  that incre-                                   ment. In  extreme programming,   tests are developed  along with  the  requirements                                   before development starts. This  helps the  testers and developers to understand the                                   requirements and ensures that there are no delays as test cases are created.                                        When a plan-driven  software process is used (e.g., for  critical  systems develop-                                   ment), testing is driven  by a set of test plans. An independent team of  testers works                                   from  these pre-formulated test plans,  which have been developed from  the system                                   specification  and design. Figure 2.7 illustrates  how  test plans are the link  between                                   testing and development activities. This is sometimes called the V-model of develop-                                   ment (turn it  on its side to see the V).                                        Acceptance  testing  is sometimes  called  ‘alpha  testing’.   Custom  systems  are                                   developed for  a single client.  The alpha testing  process continues until  the system                                   developer and the client agree that the delivered system is an acceptable implemen-                                   tation of the requirements.                                        When a system is to be marketed as a software product,  a testing process called                                   ‘beta testing’  is often used. Beta testing involves delivering  a system to a number of                                   potential customers who agree to use that system. They report  problems to the sys-                                   tem developers. This exposes the product to real use and detects errors that may not                                   have been anticipated by the system builders. After this feedback, the system is mod-                                   ified and released either for further beta testing or for  general sale.60                                                                                                                    2.3 \\x02 Coping   with  change 43   Requirements                   System                        System                        Detailed    Specification                Specification                    Design                         Design                                                               System                     Sub-System                                  Module and                       Acceptance                                                            Integration                   Integration                                      Unit Code                         Test Plan                                                             Test Plan                     Test Plan                                        and Test                                         Acceptance                     System                     Sub-System        Service                                               Test                     Integration Test           Integration TestFigure 2.7 2.2.4 Software              evolutionTesting phases                                   The flexibility   of  software systems is one of  the main reasons why more and morein a plan-drivensoftware process       software  is being incorporated in  large, complex systems. Once a decision has been                                   made to manufacture hardware, it is very expensive to make changes to the hardware                                   design. However, changes can be made to software  at any time  during or  after the                                   system development. Even extensive changes are still much cheaper than correspon-                                   ding changes to system hardware.                                       Historically,   there has always been a split between the process of software devel-                                   opment and the process of software evolution (software  maintenance). People think                                   of software  development as a creative activity in  which  a software system is devel-                                   oped from an initial  concept through to a working system. However, they sometimes                                   think of software  maintenance as dull and uninteresting. Although the costs of main-                                   tenance are often several times the initial development costs, maintenance processes                                   are sometimes considered to be less challenging than original software development.                                       This  distinction  between development and maintenance is increasingly irrelevant.                                   Hardly  any software systems are completely new systems and it makes much more                                   sense to see development and maintenance as a continuum. Rather than two separate                                   processes, it is more  realistic  to think   of software  engineering  as an evolutionary                                   process (Figure  2.8)  where  software  is  continually   changed over  its  lifetime   in                                   response to changing requirements and customer needs.                       2.3 Coping              with       change                                   Change is inevitable in all  large software projects. The system requirements change                                   as the business procuring the system responds to external pressures and management                                   priorities change. As new technologies become available, new design and implemen-                                   tation possibilities  emerge. Therefore whatever software process model is used, it is                                   essential that it can accommodate changes to the software being developed.6144 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                           Define System         Assess Existing       Propose System            Modify                                           Requirements               Systems                   Changes                 Systems                                                                          Existing                                                             NewFigure 2.8 System                                            Systems                                                           Systemevolution                                        Change adds to the costs of software development because it usually means that                                   work that has been completed has to be redone. This is called rework. For example, if                                   the relationships between the requirements in a system have been analyzed and new                                   requirements are then identified,  some or all  of the requirements analysis has to be                                   repeated. It may then be necessary to redesign the system to deliver the new require-                                   ments, change any programs that have been developed, and re-test the system.                                        There are two related approaches that may be used to reduce the costs of rework:                                   1. Change   avoidance, where the software process includes activities that can antic-                                          ipate possible changes before significant rework is required. For example, a pro-                                          totype  system may be developed  to show some key  features of  the system to                                          customers. They  can experiment  with  the  prototype  and refine  their require-                                          ments before committing  to high software production  costs.                                   2. Change    tolerance, where the process is designed so that changes can be accom-                                          modated at relatively low  cost. This normally  involves  some form of incremen-                                          tal  development.  Proposed changes may be  implemented  in  increments  that                                          have not yet been developed. If this is  impossible, then only  a single increment                                          (a small part of the system) may have to be altered to incorporate the change.                                        In this  section, I discuss two  ways of  coping with  change and changing  system                                   requirements. These are:                                   1. System   prototyping, where a version of the system or part of the system is developed                                          quickly  to check the customer’s requirements and the feasibility of  some design                                          decisions. This supports change avoidance as it allows users to experiment with the                                          system before delivery and so refine their requirements. The number of require-                                          ments change proposals made after delivery is therefore likely to be reduced.                                   2. Incremental    delivery, where system increments are delivered to the customer for                                          comment  and  experimentation.   This   supports  both  change  avoidance  and                                          change tolerance. It  avoids the premature commitment  to requirements for  the                                          whole system and allows changes to be incorporated into later increments at rel-                                          atively low  cost.                                        The notion of  refactoring,  namely improving  the structure and organization  of a                                   program, is also  an important mechanism that  supports change tolerance. I discuss                                   this in Chapter 3, which  covers agile methods.62                                                                                                                    2.3 \\x02 Coping   with  change 45                                           Establish                      Define                                          Prototype                    Prototype                    Develop                     Evaluate                                          Objectives                Functionality                 Prototype                   PrototypeFigure 2.9 The process    Prototyping                    Outline                    Executable                  Evaluationof prototype                           Plan                        Definition                    Prototype                     Reportdevelopment                     2.3.1 Prototyping                                   A  prototype is  an initial   version of  a software  system that is  used to demonstrate                                   concepts, try out design options, and find  out more about the problem and its possi-                                   ble solutions. Rapid, iterative  development of the prototype is essential so that costs                                   are controlled  and system stakeholders can experiment with  the prototype  early in                                   the software process.                                       A  software  prototype   can be used in  a software  development  process to  help                                   anticipate changes that may be required:                                   1. In    the  requirements engineering process, a prototype can help with  the elicita-                                          tion and validation  of system requirements.                                   2. In    the system design process, a prototype can be used to explore particular soft-                                          ware solutions and to support user interface design.                                       System  prototypes allow  users to see how well  the system supports  their work.                                   They may get new ideas for requirements, and find areas of strength and weakness in                                   the software. They may then propose new system requirements. Furthermore, as the                                   prototype is developed, it  may reveal errors and omissions  in the requirements that                                   have been proposed. A function described in a specification may seem useful and well                                   defined. However, when that function  is combined  with other  functions, users often                                   find that their initial  view  was incorrect or incomplete. The system specification may                                   then be modified to reflect their changed understanding of the requirements.                                       A  system prototype may be used while  the system is being designed to carry out                                   design experiments  to check  the feasibility   of a  proposed design. For  example, a                                   database design may be prototyped and tested to check that it supports efficient data                                   access for the most common user queries. Prototyping is also an essential part of the                                   user interface design process. Because of the dynamic nature of user interfaces, tex-                                   tual descriptions and diagrams are not good enough for expressing the user interface                                   requirements. Therefore,  rapid  prototyping  with  end-user involvement  is  the only                                   sensible way to develop graphical user interfaces for software systems.                                       A  process model for  prototype  development is shown  in Figure  2.9. The objec-                                   tives of prototyping  should be made explicit from the start of the process. These may                                   be to develop a system to prototype the user interface, to develop a system to validate                                   functional system requirements, or to develop a system to demonstrate the feasibility6346 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                   of the application to managers. The same prototype cannot meet all objectives. If the                                   objectives are left unstated, management or end-users may misunderstand the func-                                   tion of the prototype.  Consequently, they may not get the benefits that they expected                                   from the prototype  development.                                        The next stage in  the process  is to decide  what  to put  into  and, perhaps more                                   importantly,  what to leave out of  the prototype system. To reduce prototyping  costs                                   and accelerate the delivery  schedule, you may  leave some functionality   out of  the                                   prototype.  You may decide  to relax  non-functional  requirements such as response                                   time and memory utilization.  Error handling and management may be ignored unless                                   the objective of the prototype  is to establish a user interface. Standards of reliability                                   and program quality may be reduced.                                        The final  stage of the  process is prototype  evaluation. Provision  must be made                                   during  this stage for  user training  and the  prototype  objectives should  be used to                                   derive a plan for evaluation. Users need time to become comfortable with a new sys-                                   tem and to settle into a normal pattern of usage. Once they are using the system nor-                                   mally, they then discover requirements errors and omissions.                                        A general problem with  prototyping  is that  the prototype may not necessarily be                                   used in the same way as the final system. The tester of the prototype may not be typ-                                   ical of  system users. The training  time during  prototype evaluation  may be insuffi-                                   cient. If  the prototype  is slow,  the evaluators may adjust their  way of  working  and                                   avoid those system features that have slow response times. When provided with bet-                                   ter response in the final system, they may use it in a different way.                                        Developers are sometimes pressured by  managers to deliver  throwaway  proto-                                   types, particularly  when there are delays in  delivering  the final  version of  the soft-                                   ware. However, this is usually unwise:                                   1. It    may be impossible to tune the prototype to meet non-functional  requirements,                                          such as performance, security,  robustness, and reliability  requirements,  which                                          were ignored during  prototype development.                                   2. Rapid    change during development inevitably means that the prototype is undoc-                                          umented. The only  design specification is  the prototype code. This  is not good                                          enough for long-term  maintenance.                                   3. The    changes made during prototype  development will  probably  have degraded                                          the system structure. The system will be difficult   and expensive to maintain.                                   4. Organizational    quality standards are normally relaxed for prototype development.                                        Prototypes do not have to  be executable to be useful.  Paper-based mock-ups of                                   the system user interface (Rettig,  1994)  can be effective in  helping  users refine an                                   interface design and work through usage scenarios. These are very cheap to develop                                   and can be constructed in a few days. An extension of  this technique is a Wizard of                                   Oz prototype  where  only  the user interface  is developed. Users  interact with   this                                   interface but their  requests are passed to a person who interprets them and outputs                                   the appropriate response.64                                                                                                                    2.3 \\x02 Coping   with  change 47               Define Outline            Assign Requirements         Design System          Develop System                Requirements                to Increments                  Architecture                  Increment                                                                                                                                            System                                                                                                                                            Incomplete?

In  an incremental delivery  process, customers iden-                                   tify, in  outline, the services to be provided by the system. They identify which  of the                                   services are most  important  and which  are least important   to them.  A number  of                                   delivery increments are then defined, with  each increment providing a sub-set of the                                   system functionality. The allocation  of services to increments depends on the service                                   priority,  with the highest-priority   services implemented and delivered first.                                       Once  the system increments have been identified, the requirements for  the serv-                                   ices to be delivered in the first  increment  are defined in detail and that increment  is                                   developed. During  development, further  requirements analysis for  later increments                                   can take place but requirements changes for the current increment are not accepted.                                       Once an increment  is completed and delivered, customers can put it into  service.                                   This means that they take early delivery of part of the system functionality. They  can                                   experiment with the system and this helps them clarify their requirements for later sys-                                   tem increments. As new increments are completed, they are integrated with existing                                   increments so that the system functionality improves with each delivered increment.                                       Incremental  delivery has a number of advantages:                                   1. Customers    can use the early increments as prototypes and gain experience that                                          informs their  requirements for later system increments. Unlike prototypes, these                                          are part of the real system so there is no re-learning when the complete system is                                          available.                                   2. Customers    do not  have to wait  until  the entire system is delivered  before they                                          can gain value from  it.  The first  increment satisfies their  most critical  require-                                          ments so they can use the software immediately.                                   3. The    process maintains the benefits of incremental development in that it  should                                          be relatively easy to incorporate changes into the system.                                   4. As     the highest-priority   services  are delivered  first  and increments  then inte-                                          grated, the most important system services receive the most testing. This means6548 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                          that customers are less likely  to encounter software failures  in the most impor-                                          tant parts of the system.                                        However, there are problems with incremental delivery:                                   1. Most    systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the                                          system. As  requirements are  not defined  in detail  until  an increment  is  to be                                          implemented, it  can be hard to identify common  facilities that are needed by all                                          increments.                                   2. Iterative    development can also be difficult   when a replacement system is being                                          developed. Users want all  of  the functionality   of the old  system and are often                                          unwilling  to experiment with  an incomplete new system. Therefore, getting use-                                          ful  customer feedback is difficult.                                   3. The    essence of iterative processes is that the specification is developed in conjunc-                                          tion  with  the software. However, this  conflicts  with  the procurement model  of                                          many organizations, where the complete system specification is part of the system                                          development contract. In the incremental approach, there is no complete system                                          specification until  the final  increment  is specified. This  requires a new form of                                          contract, which large customers such as government agencies may find difficult to                                          accommodate.                                        There are some types of system where incremental  development and delivery  is                                   not the best approach. These are very large systems where development may involve                                   teams working  in different  locations,  some embedded systems where the software                                   depends on hardware development and some critical systems where all the require-                                   ments must be analyzed to check for interactions that may compromise the safety or                                   security of the system.                                        These systems, of course, suffer from the same problems of uncertain and chang-                                   ing requirements. Therefore, to address these problems and get some of the benefits                                   of incremental  development, a process may be used in which a system prototype  is                                   developed  iteratively   and  used as a  platform   for  experiments   with  the  system                                   requirements and design. With the  experience gained from the prototype,  definitive                                   requirements can then be agreed.                     2.3.3 Boehm’s         spiral    model                                   A  risk-driven   software  process framework   (the  spiral  model)   was proposed  by                                   Boehm (1988).  This  is shown in  Figure  2.11. Here, the software  process is repre-                                   sented as a spiral, rather than a sequence of activities with some backtracking  from                                   one activity  to  another. Each loop  in the  spiral represents a phase of the  software                                   process. Thus, the innermost  loop might  be concerned with  system feasibility,   the                                   next loop with  requirements definition,  the next loop with  system design, and so on.

Objective        setting Specific      objectives   for   that  phase  of  the  project    are defined.                                               Constraints    on the  process  and the  product  are  identified   and  a detailed   manage-                                               ment   plan   is   drawn   up.   Project    risks   are  identified.      Alternative      strategies,                                               depending   on  these risks,   may  be planned.                                       2. Risk      assessment  and  reduction For    each of  the  identified   project   risks,  a  detailed                                               analysis  is  carried  out.  Steps are taken  to reduce  the risk.  For  example,  if  there  is a                                               risk  that  the requirements   are inappropriate,   a prototype   system may  be developed.                                       3. Development        and  validation After      risk  evaluation,    a development   model   for  the                                               system   is chosen.   For  example,   throwaway    prototyping    may   be the  best  devel-                                               opment   approach  if  user  interface  risks   are dominant.   If  safety  risks  are  the main                                               consideration,     development    based  on  formal   transformations     may  be  the  most                                               appropriate    process,  and so  on. If  the  main  identified    risk  is  sub-system   integra-                                               tion,   the waterfall    model  may   be the  best development    model  to  use.                                       4. Planning The         project  is  reviewed   and a  decision  made  whether   to  continue   with                                               a further   loop  of  the spiral.   If  it is  decided  to  continue,   plans are  drawn  up for  the                                               next  phase  of  the project.6750 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processes                                   The main difference between the spiral  model and other software process models is                                   its explicit  recognition  of risk. A  cycle of the spiral  begins by elaborating objectives                                   such as performance and functionality.   Alternative  ways of  achieving these objec-                                   tives, and dealing with  the constraints  on each of them, are then enumerated. Each                                   alternative is assessed against each objective and sources of project risk are identi-                                   fied. The next  step is to resolve these risks by information-gathering  activities  such                                   as more detailed analysis, prototyping, and simulation.                                        Once risks have been assessed, some development is carried out, followed by a plan-                                   ning activity for the next phase of the process. Informally, risk simply means something                                   that can go wrong. For example, if the intention is to use a new programming language,                                   a risk is that the available compilers are unreliable or do not produce sufficiently effi-                                   cient object code. Risks lead to proposed software changes and project problems such as                                   schedule and cost overrun, so risk minimization is a very important project management                                   activity.  Risk management, an essential part  of project  management, is covered in                                   Chapter 22.                       2.4 The           Rational           Unified          Process                                   The Rational  Unified  Process (RUP) (Krutchen,  2003)  is an example of  a modern                                   process model that has been derived from work on the UML and the associated Unified                                   Software Development Process (Rumbaugh, et al., 1999; Arlow and Neustadt, 2005).                                   I have included a description here, as it is a good example of a hybrid process model.                                   It brings together elements from all of the generic process models (Section 2.1), illus-                                   trates good practice in specification and design (Section 2.2) and supports prototyping                                   and incremental delivery (Section 2.3).                                        The RUP recognizes that  conventional process models present a single  view  of                                   the process. In contrast, the RUP is normally described from three perspectives:                                   1. A    dynamic  perspective, which shows the phases of the model over time.                                   2. A    static perspective, which  shows the process activities that are enacted.                                   3. A    practice perspective, which suggests good practices to be used during the process.                                        Most descriptions of the RUP attempt to combine the static and dynamic perspec-                                   tives in a single  diagram (Krutchen, 2003).  I think  that makes the process harder to                                   understand, so I use separate descriptions of each of these perspectives.                                        The RUP is  a phased model that identifies  four  discrete phases in  the software                                   process. However, unlike the waterfall model where phases are equated with process                                   activities,  the phases in  the RUP are more  closely  related to  business rather than                                   technical concerns. Figure 2.11 shows the phases in the RUP. These are:                                   1. Inception The     goal of the inception  phase is to establish a business case for the                                          system. You should identify   all external entities  (people and systems) that will68                                                                                                     2.4 \\x02 The   Rational Unified  Process 51                                                                                         Phase IterationFigure 2.12 Phases inthe Rational UnifiedProcess                           Inception        Elaboration                        Construction                         Transition                                          interact with  the system and define  these interactions. You then use this infor-                                          mation to  assess the contribution that the system makes to the business. If this                                          contribution  is minor, then the project may be cancelled after this phase.                                   2. Elaboration The     goals of the elaboration phase are to develop an understanding                                          of  the problem  domain,  establish an architectural   framework  for  the system,                                          develop the project  plan, and identify  key  project risks.  On completion  of  this                                          phase you should have a requirements model for the system, which may be a set                                          of UML   use-cases, an architectural description, and a development plan for the                                          software.                                   3. Construction The    construction  phase involves system design, programming, and                                          testing. Parts of the system are developed in parallel  and integrated during  this                                          phase. On completion of this phase, you should have a working software system                                          and associated documentation that is ready for delivery to users.                                   4. Transition The      final  phase of the  RUP is concerned  with  moving  the system                                          from the development community  to the user community and making it  work in                                          a real environment.  This is something  that is ignored in  most software process                                          models but  is,  in fact,  an expensive  and sometimes problematic   activity.  On                                          completion of  this phase, you should have a documented software system that is                                          working  correctly in  its operational environment.                                       Iteration  within  the RUP is supported in two ways. Each phase may be enacted in                                   an iterative way with  the results developed incrementally. In  addition, the whole  set                                   of phases may also be enacted incrementally,  as shown by the looping  arrow  from                                   Transition to Inception  in Figure 2.12.                                       The  static view  of  the RUP  focuses on the activities  that  take place during  the                                   development process. These are called workflows in the RUP description. There are                                   six core process workflows identified  in the process and three core supporting work-                                   flows.  The RUP has been designed in conjunction  with  the UML,  so the workflow                                   description  is oriented  around associated UML   models such as sequence models,                                   object models,  etc. The core  engineering and  support workflows   are described in                                   Figure 2.13.                                       The advantage in presenting dynamic and static views is that phases of the devel-                                   opment process are not associated with specific workflows.  In  principle  at least, all                                   of the RUP workflows  may be active at all  stages of the process. In the early phases                                   of the  process, most effort  will   probably  be spent on workflows   such as business                                   modelling  and requirements and, in the later phases, in testing and deployment.6952 Chapter       2 \\x02 Software       processes     Workflow                                                               Description     Business modelling                                               The business processes are modelled using business use cases.     Requirements                                                       Actors who interact with  the system are identified  and use                                                                                   cases are developed to model the system requirements.     Analysis and design                                              A design model is created and documented using architectural                                                                                   models, component models, object  models, and sequence                                                                                   models.     Implementation                                                     The components in the system are implemented  and                                                                                   structured into implementation  sub-systems. Automatic code                                                                                   generation from design models helps accelerate this process.     Testing                                                                  Testing is an iterative process that is carried out in conjunction                                                                                   with implementation.  System testing follows the completion  of                                                                                   the implementation.

Configuration and change management              This supporting workflow manages  changes to the system (see                                                                                   Chapter 25).

The  RUP is not  a suitable process for  all types of  development, e.g., embedded                                 software development. However, it does represent an approach that potentially com-                                 bines the three generic process models discussed in Section 2.1. The most important                                 innovations in the RUP are the separation of phases and workflows, and the recogni-                                 tion that deploying software in a user’s environment is part of the process. Phases are                                 dynamic and have goals. Workflows are static and are technical activities that are not                                 associated with  a  single  phase but may  be used  throughout  the development   to                                 achieve the goals of each phase.KEY     POINTS     \\x02 Software   processes are the activities involved in producing a software system. Software process           models are abstract representations of these processes.     \\x02 General  process models describe the organization of software processes. Examples of these general           models include the waterfall model, incremental development, and reuse-oriented development.     \\x02 Requirements   engineering is the process of developing a software specification. Specifications           are intended to communicate the system needs of the customer to the system developers.     \\x02 Design   and implementation  processes are concerned with transforming a requirements           specification into  an executable software system. Systematic design methods may be used as           part of this transformation.     \\x02 Software   validation  is the process of checking that the system conforms to its specification and           that it meets the real needs of the users of the system.     \\x02 Software   evolution  takes place when you change existing software systems to meet new           requirements. Changes are continuous and the software must evolve to remain useful.     \\x02 Processes  should  include activities to cope with change. This may involve a prototyping phase           that helps avoid poor decisions on requirements and design. Processes may be structured for           iterative development and delivery so that  changes may be made without disrupting the system           as a whole.     \\x02 The   Rational Unified Process is a modern generic process model that is organized into phases           (inception, elaboration,  construction, and transition)  but separates activities (requirements,           analysis, and design, etc.) from these phases.7154 Chapter    2 \\x02 Software    processesFURTHER      READING       Managing Software Quality and Business Risk.

The Rational Unified Process—An Introduction (3rd edition). This is the most readable book       available on the RUP at the time of this writing. Krutchen describes the process well, but        I would like to have seen more on the practical difficulties  of using the process. (P. Krutchen,       Addison-Wesley, 2003.)EXERCISES       2.1. Giving   reasons for your answer based on the type of system being developed, suggest the                most appropriate  generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing                the development  of the following systems:                A system to control anti-lock  braking in a car                A virtual reality  system to support software maintenance                A university accounting system that  replaces an existing system                An interactive travel planning  system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest                environmental  impact       2.2. Explain   why incremental development is the most effective approach for developing business                software systems. Why is this model less appropriate for real-time systems engineering?       2.3. Consider   the reuse-based process model shown in Figure 2.3. Explain why it is essential to                have two separate requirements engineering activities  in the process.       2.4. Suggest   why it is important  to make a distinction  between developing the user                requirements and developing  system requirements in the requirements engineering                 process.       2.5. Describe   the main activities in the  software design process and the outputs of these                activities. Using  a diagram, show possible relationships between the outputs  of these                activities.       2.6. Explain   why change is inevitable in complex systems and give examples (apart from                prototyping  and incremental delivery) of software  process activities that help predict changes                and make the software being developed more resilient  to change.72                                                                                                                       Chapter 2 \\x02 References 55         2.7. Explain why systems developed as prototypes should not normally  be used as production                systems.         2.8. Explain why Boehm’s spiral model is an adaptable model that can support both  change                avoidance and change tolerance activities. In practice, this model has not been widely used.                Suggest why this might  be the case.         2.9. What are the advantages of providing static and dynamic views of the software process as in                the Rational Unified Process?       2.10. Historically, the introduction of technology has caused profound changes in the labor market and,                temporarily at least, displaced people from jobs. Discuss whether the introduction of extensive                process automation is likely to have the same consequences for software engineers. If you don’t                think it will,  explain why not. If you think that it will reduce job opportunities, is it ethical for the                engineers affected to passively or actively resist the introduction of this technology?REFERENCES       Arlow, J. and Neustadt, I.

They have torespond to new opportunities  and markets, changing economic  conditions,  and theemergence of competing products and services. Software is  part of almost  all busi-ness operations so new  software  is developed  quickly   to take  advantage of  newopportunities and to respond to competitive pressure. Rapid development and deliv-ery is therefore now often the most critical requirement for software systems. In fact,many businesses  are willing    to  trade off   software  quality   and  compromise  onrequirements to achieve faster deployment of the software that they need.    Because these businesses are operating in a changing environment, it is often prac-tically impossible to derive a complete set of stable software requirements. The initialrequirements inevitably change because customers find it impossible to predict how asystem will affect working  practices, how it will interact with  other systems, and whatuser operations should be automated. It may only be after a system has been deliveredand users gain experience with it that the real requirements become clear. Even then,the requirements are likely to change quickly  and unpredictably due to external fac-tors. The software may then be out of date when it is delivered.    Software development processes that plan on completely specifying the requirementsand then designing, building, and testing the system are not geared to rapid softwaredevelopment. As the requirements change or as requirements problems are discovered,the system design or implementation has to be reworked and retested. As a consequence,a conventional waterfall or specification-based process is usually prolonged and the finalsoftware is delivered to the customer long after it was originally specified.    For some types of software, such as safety-critical control  systems, where a com-plete analysis  of the  system is essential,  a plan-driven  approach  is the right  one.However, in a fast-moving  business environment, this  can cause real problems. Bythe time the software is available for use, the original reason for its procurement mayhave changed so radically that the software is effectively useless. Therefore, for busi-ness systems in  particular,  development  processes  that focus  on  rapid  softwaredevelopment and delivery are essential.    The  need for rapid system development and processes that can handle changingrequirements  has been recognized   for  some time.  IBM   introduced   incrementaldevelopment in the 1980s (Mills  et al.,  1980). The introduction  of  so-called fourth-generation languages, also in the  1980s, supported the idea of  quickly  developingand delivering  software (Martin,  1981).  However, the  notion really  took  off  in thelate 1990s with  the development of  the notion  of agile  approaches such as DSDM(Stapleton, 1997), Scrum (Schwaber and Beedle, 2001),  and extreme programming(Beck, 1999; Beck, 2000).    Rapid  software development processes are designed to produce useful  softwarequickly. The software is not developed as a single unit but as a series of increments, witheach increment   including   new  system  functionality.   Although    there  are  manyapproaches to rapid software development, they share some fundamental characteristics:1. The    processes of  specification,   design, and  implementation   are interleaved.       There is no  detailed system  specification,  and design documentation  is mini-       mized or  generated automatically   by  the programming   environment  used to7558 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                          implement  the system. The user requirements document only  defines the most                                          important characteristics of  the system.                                   2. The    system  is developed in  a series of  versions.  End-users and other system                                          stakeholders are involved in  specifying and evaluating each version. They  may                                          propose changes to the software  and new  requirements that should  be imple-                                          mented in a later version of the system.                                   3. System    user interfaces  are often  developed using  an interactive  development                                          system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by drawing and plac-                                          ing icons on the interface. The system may then generate a web-based interface for                                          a browser or an interface for a specific platform such as Microsoft Windows.                                        Agile methods are incremental development methods in which the increments are                                   small and, typically, new releases of the system are created and made available to cus-                                   tomers every two or three weeks. They involve customers in the development process                                   to get rapid  feedback on changing requirements. They  minimize  documentation by                                   using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents.                       3.1 Agile             methods                                   In the  1980s and early  1990s,  there was a widespread  view  that  the best way  to                                   achieve better  software was  through careful  project  planning,  formalized   quality                                   assurance, the use of analysis and  design methods supported by  CASE  tools, and                                   controlled  and rigorous software  development processes. This view came from  the                                   software engineering  community  that  was responsible for  developing  large, long-                                   lived software systems such as aerospace and government systems.                                        This software was developed by large teams working for different companies. Teams                                   were often geographically dispersed and worked on the software for  long periods of                                   time. An example of this type of software is the control systems for a modern aircraft,                                   which might  take up to 10 years from initial specification to deployment. These plan-                                   driven approaches involve a significant overhead in planning, designing, and document-                                   ing the system. This overhead is justified when the work of multiple development teams                                   has to be coordinated, when the system is a critical system, and when many different                                   people will be involved in maintaining the software over its lifetime.                                        However, when this  heavyweight, plan-driven  development approach is  applied                                   to small and medium-sized business systems, the overhead involved is so large that it                                   dominates the software development process. More time is spent on how the system                                   should  be developed  than  on program  development   and testing.  As  the  system                                   requirements change, rework is essential and, in principle  at  least, the specification                                   and design has to change with the program.                                        Dissatisfaction with  these heavyweight approaches to software engineering led a                                   number of software  developers in the 1990s to propose new ‘agile  methods’. These                                   allowed the development team to focus on the software itself rather than on its design76                                                                                         3.1 \\x02 Agile    methods 59and documentation. Agile methods universally rely on an incremental approach to soft-ware specification, development, and delivery. They are best suited to application devel-opment where the system requirements usually change rapidly during the developmentprocess. They are intended to deliver working software quickly to customers, who canthen propose new and changed requirements to be included in later iterations of the sys-tem. They aim to cut down on process bureaucracy by avoiding work that has dubiouslong-term value and eliminating documentation that will probably never be used.    The philosophy  behind agile methods is reflected  in the agile manifesto  that wasagreed on by many of the leading developers of these methods. This manifesto states:    We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing  it and helping    others do it.  Through this work we have come to value:        Individuals  and interactions  over processes and tools        Working  software over comprehensive documentation         Customer collaboration   over contract negotiation        Responding to change over following  a plan    That is, while  there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the    left  more.    Probably  the  best-known  agile method  is extreme  programming  (Beck,  1999;Beck, 2000), which  I  describe later in  this chapter. Other agile  approaches includeScrum  (Cohn,   2009;  Schwaber,  2004;   Schwaber  and  Beedle,   2001),  Crystal(Cockburn, 2001;  Cockburn,  2004), Adaptive  Software  Development  (Highsmith,2000), DSDM  (Stapleton, 1997; Stapleton, 2003), and Feature Driven Development(Palmer and Felsing, 2002). The success of these methods has led to some integrationwith more traditional  development methods based on system modelling, resulting inthe notion of agile  modelling (Ambler  and Jeffries, 2002) and agile instantiations  ofthe Rational Unified Process (Larman, 2002).    Although  these agile methods are all based around the notion of incremental devel-opment and delivery, they propose different processes to achieve this. However, theyshare a set of principles, based on the agile manifesto, and so have much in common.These principles are shown in Figure 3.1. Different agile methods instantiate these prin-ciples in different ways and I don’t  have space to discuss all agile methods. Instead, Ifocus on two of the most widely used methods: extreme programming (Section 3.3) andScrum (Section 3.4).    Agile  methods have been very successful for some types of system development:1. Product     development  where  a  software  company  is  developing  a  small  or       medium-sized product for  sale.2. Custom    system development within an organization, where there is a clear com-       mitment from  the customer to become involved in the development process and       where there are not a lot of external rules and regulations that affect the software.7760 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development    Principle                                 Description    Customer involvement           Customers should be closely involved throughout the development process.                                                  Their role is provide and prioritize new system requirements and to evaluate                                                  the iterations of the system.    Incremental delivery              The software is developed in increments with the customer specifying the                                                  requirements to be included in each increment.    People not process                The skills of the development team should be recognized and exploited. Team                                                  members should be left to develop their own ways of working without                                                  prescriptive processes.    Embrace change                   Expect the system requirements to change and so design the system to                                                  accommodate these changes.    Maintain simplicity                 Focus on simplicity in both the software being developed and in the                                                  development process. Wherever possible, actively work to eliminate complexity                                                  from the system.                                       As  I discuss in the final  section of  this chapter, the success of agile methods hasFigure 3.1 Theprinciples of agile       meant that there is a lot of interest in using these methods for other types of softwaremethods                     development. However,  because of their  focus  on small,  tightly  integrated  teams,                                   there are problems in  scaling them  to large systems. There  have also been experi-                                   ments in  using  agile approaches  for critical   systems engineering   (Drobna  et al.,                                   2004). However, because of the need for security, safety, and dependability analysis                                   in critical  systems, agile methods require significant modification  before they can be                                   routinely  used for critical systems engineering.                                       In  practice,  the principles  underlying   agile methods  are sometimes difficult   to                                   realize:                                   1. Although     the  idea of customer  involvement  in  the development process is  an                                          attractive one, its success depends on having a customer who is willing and able                                          to spend  time with   the development  team and  who can  represent all  system                                          stakeholders. Frequently, the customer representatives are subject to other pres-                                          sures and cannot take full part in the software development.                                   2. Individual      team members may  not have suitable  personalities  for  the intense                                          involvement that is typical  of agile methods, and therefore not interact well with                                          other team members.                                   3. Prioritizing     changes can be extremely difficult,  especially  in systems for which                                          there are many stakeholders. Typically,  each stakeholder gives different priori-                                          ties to different  changes.                                   4. Maintaining      simplicity    requires  extra  work.   Under  pressure from   delivery                                          schedules, the team members may not have time  to carry out  desirable system                                          simplifications.78                                                                                         3.1 \\x02 Agile    methods 615. Many     organizations,  especially  large  companies, have spent  years changing       their culture so that processes are defined and followed. It is difficult for  them to       move to a working model in which  processes are informal and defined by devel-       opment teams.    Another   non-technical  problem—that   is  a general  problem  with   incrementaldevelopment and delivery—occurs when the system customer uses an outside organ-ization for system development. The software requirements document is usually partof the contract between the customer and the supplier. Because incremental specifi-cation is inherent  in agile  methods, writing   contracts for  this type  of developmentmay be difficult.    Consequently, agile methods have to rely on contracts in which the customer paysfor the time  required for system development rather than the development of  a spe-cific set of requirements. So long as all goes well, this benefits both the customer andthe developer. However, if  problems arise then there may be difficult   disputes overwho is  to blame and  who should  pay for  the extra  time and resources required  toresolve the problems.    Most  books and  papers that describe agile methods  and experiences with  agilemethods  talk  about  the  use  of  these  methods  for   new  systems  development.However, as I explain  in  Chapter 9, a huge  amount of  software engineering  effortgoes into the maintenance and evolution of existing software systems. There are onlya small number of  experience reports on using  agile methods for  software mainte-nance (Poole and Huisman, 2001).  There are two  questions that should be consid-ered when considering agile methods and maintenance:1. Are    systems that are developed using an agile approach maintainable, given the       emphasis in the development process of minimizing formal  documentation?2. Can    agile methods be used effectively for evolving  a system in response to cus-       tomer change requests?    Formal  documentation is  supposed to describe the system and so make it easierfor people  changing the system to  understand. In  practice, however, formal  docu-mentation is often not kept up to date and so does not accurately reflect the programcode. For this  reason, agile methods enthusiasts argue that it  is a waste of  time towrite this documentation  and that the key to implementing  maintainable software isto produce  high-quality,   readable code.  Agile  practices  therefore  emphasize theimportance of  writing   well-structured  code  and investing  effort  in code  improve-ment. Therefore, the lack of  documentation should not be a problem in  maintainingsystems developed using an agile approach.    However, my  experience of system maintenance suggests that the key documentis the system requirements  document,  which  tells the  software engineer  what thesystem is supposed to do. Without such knowledge, it is difficult to assess the impactof proposed system changes. Many  agile methods collect  requirements informallyand incrementally   and do  not  create a coherent  requirements  document.  In  this7962 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                   respect, the use of agile methods is likely   to make subsequent system maintenance                                   more difficult  and expensive.                                       Agile  practices, used in the maintenance process itself, are likely  to  be effective,                                   whether or not an agile approach has been used for system development. Incremental                                   delivery, design for change and maintaining simplicity  all make sense when software                                   is being changed. In fact, you can think of an agile development process as a process                                   of software evolution.                                       However,  the main difficulty   after  software delivery  is likely  to  be keeping cus-                                   tomers involved in  the process. Although a customer may be able to justify  the full-                                   time involvement  of  a representative during system development, this is  less likely                                   during maintenance where changes are not continuous. Customer representatives are                                   likely  to  lose interest in  the system. Therefore,  it  is likely   that alternative  mecha-                                   nisms, such as change proposals, discussed in Chapter 25, will be required to create                                   the new system requirements.                                       The  other problem that is likely  to arise is maintaining  continuity  of the develop-                                   ment team.  Agile   methods rely  on  team members  understanding  aspects of  the                                   system without  having  to consult  documentation. If  an  agile development  team is                                   broken up, then this implicit  knowledge  is lost and it is difficult   for new team mem-                                   bers to build up the same understanding of the system and its components.                                       Supporters  of  agile methods have been evangelical  in  promoting  their  use and                                   have tended to overlook their  shortcomings. This  has prompted an equally extreme                                   response, which, in my view, exaggerates the problems with this approach (Stephens                                   and  Rosenberg,  2003).  More   reasoned  critics   such  as  DeMarco   and  Boehm                                   (DeMarco  and Boehm,  2002) highlight   both the  advantages and disadvantages of                                   agile methods.  They propose a hybrid   approach where agile  methods incorporate                                   some techniques from plan-driven development may be the best way forward.                       3.2 Plan-driven                    and      agile       development                                   Agile approaches to software development consider design and implementation to be                                   the central activities in the software process. They incorporate other activities, such as                                   requirements elicitation  and testing, into design and implementation.  By  contrast, a                                   plan-driven approach to  software engineering  identifies separate stages in the soft-                                   ware process with outputs associated with each stage. The outputs from one stage are                                   used as a basis for planning the following process activity. Figure  3.2 shows the dis-                                   tinctions between plan-driven and agile approaches to system specification.                                       In  a plan-driven  approach,  iteration  occurs within   activities  with  formal  docu-                                   ments used to communicate between stages of the process. For example, the require-                                   ments will   evolve and, ultimately,   a requirements  specification  will  be  produced.                                   This is then an input to the design and implementation process. In an agile approach,                                   iteration  occurs across activities.   Therefore,  the requirements  and the  design are                                   developed together, rather than separately.80                                                                                          3.2 \\x02 Plan-driven    and  agile development 63                                                 Plan-Based Development                                                    Requirements                 Requirements                  Design and                                                      Engineering                   Specification                Implementation                                                                                       Requirements Change                                                                                                 Requests                                                 Agile Development                                                                       Requirements                            Design and                                                                        Engineering                           ImplementationFigure 3.2 Plan-drivenand agile specification                                        A plan-driven  software process can support incremental development and deliv-                                   ery. It is perfectly  feasible to allocate requirements and plan the design and develop-                                   ment phase as a series of increments. An agile process is not inevitably code-focused                                   and it may  produce some design documentation. As I  discuss in the following   sec-                                   tion,  the agile  development team may  decide to  include a documentation  ‘spike’,                                   where, instead of  producing  a new version  of  a system, the team  produce system                                   documentation.                                        In fact,  most  software  projects  include   practices  from  plan-driven   and agile                                   approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile approach,                                   you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational questions:                                     1. Is  it important  to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to                                          implementation? If  so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.                                     2. Is  an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers                                          and get rapid feedback from them, realistic? If so, consider using agile methods.                                     3. How  large is the system that is being developed? Agile methods are most effec-                                          tive when  the system can be developed with  a small  co-located team who can                                          communicate informally.  This may not be possible for large systems that require                                          larger development teams so a plan-driven approach may have to be used.                                     4. What  type  of system is being developed? Systems that require a lot of  analysis                                          before  implementation  (e.g.,  real-time  system  with  complex  timing  require-                                          ments) usually  need a fairly  detailed design to  carry out this  analysis. A  plan-                                          driven approach may be best in those circumstances.                                     5. What  is the expected system lifetime? Long-lifetime   systems may require more                                          design documentation   to communicate  the  original  intentions   of  the system8164 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                          developers to the  support team. However,  supporters of agile  methods rightly                                          argue that documentation is frequently  not kept up to date and it is not of  much                                          use for long-term system maintenance.                                     6. What  technologies are available to support system development? Agile methods                                          often rely on good tools  to keep track of an evolving design. If  you are develop-                                          ing a system using an IDE that  does not have good tools for program visualiza-                                          tion and analysis, then more design documentation may be required.                                     7. How  is the development team organized? If the development team is distributed                                          or if  part of the development is being outsourced, then you may need to develop                                          design documents  to  communicate  across the development  teams. You  may                                          need to plan in advance what these are.                                     8. Are   there cultural  issues that may affect  the system development? Traditional                                          engineering organizations  have a culture of  plan-based development, as this is                                          the norm in engineering. This  usually requires extensive design documentation,                                          rather than the informal  knowledge used in agile processes.                                     9. How   good are the designers and programmers  in the  development team? It  is                                          sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than plan-based                                          approaches in which programmers simply  translate a detailed design into code.                                          If  you have a team with relatively low  skill  levels, you may need to use the best                                          people to develop the design, with others responsible for programming.                                   10. Is  the system subject to external regulation? If a system has to be approved by an                                          external regulator (e.g., the Federal Aviation Authority   [FAA]  approve software                                          that is critical  to the operation of an aircraft)  then you will  probably be required                                          to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.                                       In  reality, the issue of whether a project  can be labelled as plan-driven or agile is                                   not very important.  Ultimately,  the primary  concern of  buyers of a software system                                   is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and                                   does useful things for the individual  user or the organization. In practice, many com-                                   panies who claim to have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and                                   have integrated these with their plan-driven processes.                       3.3 Extreme                programming                                   Extreme programming  (XP) is perhaps the best known and most widely  used of the                                   agile methods.  The name  was coined  by Beck  (2000)  because the approach was                                   developed by pushing  recognized good  practice, such as iterative  development, to                                   ‘extreme’ levels. For example, in XP, several new versions of a system may be devel-                                   oped by different programmers, integrated and tested in a day.82                                                                                                               3.3 \\x02 Extreme    programming 65                                                     Select User                                                                                             Break Down                                                   Stories for this                                                           Plan Release                                                                                          Stories to Tasks                                                       Release                                                                                                                                       Develop/Figure 3.3 The extreme                 Evaluate                           Release                                                                                                                                       Integrate/programming release                      System                           Softwarecycle                                                                                                                            Test Software                                        In extreme programming,   requirements are expressed as scenarios (called user                                   stories), which  are implemented directly  as a series of tasks. Programmers work  in                                   pairs and develop tests for each task before writing  the code. All  tests must be suc-                                   cessfully executed when new code is integrated into the system. There is a short time                                   gap between releases of the system. Figure 3.3 illustrates the XP process to produce                                   an increment of the system that is being developed.                                        Extreme programming involves a number of practices, summarized in Figure 3.4,                                   which reflect  the principles of agile  methods:                                   1. Incremental     development is supported  through small,  frequent  releases of the                                          system. Requirements are based on simple customer stories or scenarios that are                                          used as a basis for deciding what  functionality   should be included in  a system                                          increment.                                   2. Customer    involvement  is supported through  the continuous engagement of the                                          customer in the development team. The customer representative takes part in the                                          development and is responsible for defining  acceptance tests for the system.                                   3. People,    not process, are supported through pair programming, collective owner-                                          ship of  the system code, and a  sustainable development process that does not                                          involve excessively long  working hours.                                   4. Change    is  embraced through  regular  system releases to  customers, test-first                                          development, refactoring  to  avoid code degeneration, and  continuous integra-                                          tion of  new functionality.                                   5. Maintaining     simplicity   is supported by constant refactoring that  improves code                                          quality  and by using simple  designs that do not unnecessarily anticipate future                                          changes to the system.                                        In an XP process, customers are intimately involved in specifying and prioritizing                                   system requirements. The requirements are not specified as lists of required  system                                   functions. Rather, the system customer is part of the development team and discusses                                   scenarios with other team members. Together, they develop a ‘story card’ that encap-                                   sulates the customer needs. The development team then aims to implement that sce-                                   nario in  a future release of the software. An  example of  a story card for  the mental8366 Chapter       3 \\x02 Agile      software    development     Principle   or practice               Description     Incremental planning               Requirements are recorded on  Story Cards and the Stories to be included in a                                                      release are determined by the time  available and their relative priority. The                                                      developers break these Stories into development ‘Tasks’. See Figures 3.5 and 3.6.     Small releases                         The minimal  useful set of functionality that  provides business value is developed                                                      first. Releases of the system are frequent and incrementally add functionality to                                                      the first release.     Simple design                          Enough design is carried out to meet  the current requirements  and no more.     Test-first development             An automated  unit test framework  is used to write tests for a new  piece of                                                      functionality before  that functionality itself  is implemented.     Refactoring                              All developers are expected to refactor the  code continuously as soon as possible                                                      code improvements are found.  This keeps the code simple and maintainable.     Pair programming                    Developers work in  pairs, checking each other’s work and providing the support                                                      to always do a good job.     Collective ownership                The pairs of developers work on all areas of the system, so that no islands of                                                      expertise develop and all the developers take responsibility  for all of the code.                                                      Anyone can change anything.     Continuous integration             As soon as the work on a task is complete, it is integrated  into the whole  system.                                                      After any such integration, all the unit  tests in the system must pass.

In an extreme programming                                                      process, the customer is a member of the development  team and is responsible                                                      for bringing system requirements  to the team for implementation.                                       health   care   patient    management    system   is  shown    in  Figure    3.5.  This    is  a shortFigure 3.4 Extremeprogramming practices description     of  a scenario   for  prescribing    medication   for  a  patient.                                            The   story  cards  are  the  main  inputs   to  the  XP  planning    process  or  the ‘planning                                       game’.   Once the  story  cards  have been developed,   the development    team breaks  these                                       down  into  tasks  (Figure  3.6)  and  estimates  the effort   and resources  required  for  imple-                                       menting   each  task.  This  usually   involves   discussions   with   the  customer  to  refine   the                                       requirements.    The customer   then  prioritizes    the stories   for  implementation,    choosing                                       those  stories   that  can  be  used  immediately     to  deliver   useful   business  support.    The                                       intention    is  to  identify    useful    functionality     that   can  be implemented     in  about   two                                       weeks,  when  the  next  release of  the  system  is made  available   to the  customer.                                            Of   course,  as requirements    change,  the  unimplemented    stories   change  or  may  be                                       discarded.   If  changes  are  required   for  a system   that has  already  been  delivered,   new                                       story   cards  are  developed   and  again,   the  customer    decides  whether    these  changes                                       should   have priority    over  new  functionality.84                                                                                                                             3.3 \\x02 Extreme       programming 67                                               Prescribing  Medication                                               Kate is a doctor who wishes to prescribe medication for  a patient attending  a clinic.                                               The patient record is already displayed on her computer so she clicks on the                                               medication field  and can select current medication’, ‘new medication’   or ‘formulary’.                                               If she selects ‘current medication’, the system asks her to check the dose. If she                                               wants to change the dose, she enters the dose and then confirms  the prescription.                                               If she chooses ‘new medication’, the system assumes that she knows which                                               medication to  prescribe. She types the first few letters of the drug name. The system                                               displays a list of possible drugs starting with these letters. She chooses the required                                               medication and the  system responds by asking her to check that the medication                                               selected is correct. She enters the dose and then confirms the prescription.                                               If she chooses ‘formulary’, the system displays a search box for the approved                                               formulary. She can then search for the drug required. She selects a drug and is asked                                               to check that the medication  is correct. She enters the dose and then confirms the                                               prescription.                                               The system always checks that the dose is within the approved range. If it isn’t, Kate                                               is asked to change the dose.                                               After Kate has confirmed the prescription, it will  be displayed for checking. She eitherFigure 3.5 A                           clicks ‘OK’ or ‘Change’.

Sometimes,   during   the  planning   game,   questions  that   cannot  be  easily  answered                                       come  to  light  and  additional   work   is required   to  explore  possible   solutions.   The  team                                       may  carry   out some  prototyping     or trial   development   to  understand   the  problem   and                                       solution.   In  XP  terms,  this  is  a ‘spike’,   an  increment   where  no  programming    is  done.                                       There   may  also  be  ‘spikes’    to  design  the  system   architecture    or  to  develop   system                                       documentation.                                             Extreme   programming    takes  an ‘extreme’    approach   to  incremental    development.                                       New   versions   of  the  software    may  be  built   several   times   per  day  and  releases  are                                       delivered     to  customers    roughly     every   two   weeks.    Release   deadlines    are   never                                       slipped;   if  there  are  development    problems,   the  customer   is consulted   and  function-                                       ality   is removed   from   the planned   release.                                             When  a programmer    builds  the  system  to create  a new  version,  he  or she must  run                                       all  existing    automated   tests  as  well   as the  tests  for  the  new  functionality.      The  new                                       build   of   the  software    is  accepted   only   if  all   tests  execute   successfully.     This  then                                       becomes  the  basis  for  the  next  iteration   of  the system.                                             A  fundamental     precept   of  traditional      software   engineering     is  that   you  should                                       design  for   change.  That  is,  you  should   anticipate   future   changes  to the  software   and                                       design   it  so  that  these  changes  can  be  easily  implemented.     Extreme   programming,                                       however,   has discarded   this  principle    on  the basis  that  designing    for  change  is  often                                       wasted  effort.   It  isn’t   worth   taking   time  to  add  generality   to  a program    to cope  with                                       change.   The  changes   anticipated    often   never  materialize    and  completely     different                                       change   requests   may  actually    be  made.   Therefore,    the  XP   approach   accepts   that                                       changes  will   happen  and  reorganize   the software   when  these  changes  actually   occur.8568 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                                          Task 1: Change Dose of Prescribed Drug                                                                Task 2: Formulary Selection                                                                       Task 3: Dose Checking                                                                    Dose checking is a safety precaution to check that                                                                    the doctor has not prescribed a dangerously small                                                                    or large dose.

A  general problem  with  incremental development  is that it  tends to degrade the                                   software structure, so changes to the software  become harder and harder to imple-                                   ment. Essentially,  the development proceeds by finding  workarounds  to problems,                                   with the result that code is often duplicated,  parts of the software are reused in inap-                                   propriate ways, and the overall structure degrades as code is added to the system.                                       Extreme   programming   tackles  this  problem  by  suggesting  that the  software                                   should be constantly  refactored.  This  means that the programming   team look  for                                   possible improvements  to the software  and implement  them immediately.  When  a                                   team member sees code that can be improved, they make these improvements even                                   in situations  where there is  no immediate  need for them.  Examples of  refactoring                                   include the  reorganization of  a class hierarchy  to remove duplicate  code, the tidy-                                   ing up  and renaming of  attributes and methods,  and the replacement of  code with                                   calls to methods defined in a program  library. Program development  environments,                                   such as Eclipse  (Carlson, 2005),  include  tools  for  refactoring  which  simplify   the                                   process of  finding  dependencies between  code sections and  making  global  code                                   modifications.                                       In  principle then, the software should always be easy to understand and change as                                   new stories  are implemented.  In practice,  this  is not  always the  case. Sometimes                                   development pressure means that refactoring is delayed because the time is devoted                                   to the implementation  of new functionality.   Some new features and changes cannot                                   readily be  accommodated by code-level refactoring  and require  the architecture of                                   the system to be modified.                                       In  practice, many companies that have adopted XP do not  use all of the extreme                                   programming practices listed in  Figure 3.4. They pick  and choose according to their                                   local ways of  working.  For example, some companies find  pair programming  help-                                   ful;  others prefer to use individual  programming and reviews. To accommodate dif-                                   ferent levels of  skill,  some programmers don’t do refactoring  in parts of  the system                                   they did  not develop, and conventional  requirements may  be used rather than user                                   stories.  However,  most  companies  who  have adopted  an  XP  variant  use small                                   releases, test-first development, and continuous integration.86                                                                                          3.3 \\x02 Extreme   programming 693.3.1 Testing        in  XP             As  I discussed in the  introduction  to this  chapter, one of the  important differences             between incremental  development and plan-driven  development is  in  the way that             the system is tested. With incremental development, there is no system specification             that can  be used by an external  testing team to  develop system tests. As  a conse-             quence, some approaches to incremental development have a very informal   testing             process, in comparison with plan-driven  testing.                  To avoid some of  the problems of testing  and system validation, XP  emphasizes             the importance of  program testing. XP  includes an approach to testing  that reduces             the chances of introducing undiscovered errors into the current version of the system.                  The key features of testing in XP  are:             1. Test-first     development,             2. incremental     test development from scenarios,             3. user    involvement in  the test development and validation, and             4. the    use of automated testing frameworks.                  Test-first development is one of the most important  innovations in  XP. Instead of             writing  some code and then writing tests for that code, you write the tests before you             write  the code. This means that you can run the test as the code is being written and             discover problems during  development.                  Writing  tests implicitly   defines both an interface  and a specification of  behavior             for the functionality  being developed. Problems of requirements and interface misun-             derstandings are reduced. This approach can be adopted in any process in which there             is a clear relationship between a system requirement and the code implementing that             requirement. In XP, you can always see this link because the story cards representing             the requirements are broken down  into  tasks and the tasks are the principal  unit of             implementation. The adoption of test-first development in XP has led to more general             test-driven approaches to development (Astels, 2003). I discuss these in Chapter 8.                  In test-first  development,  the task implementers  have to thoroughly  understand             the specification so that they can write tests for the system. This means that ambigu-             ities  and omissions in  the specification  have to be clarified  before  implementation             begins. Furthermore, it also avoids the problem of  ‘test-lag’.  This may happen when             the developer of  the system works at a faster pace than the tester. The implementa-             tion gets further and further  ahead of the testing and there is a tendency to skip tests,             so that the development schedule can be maintained.                  User requirements in XP are expressed as scenarios or stories and the user priori-             tizes  these for  development.  The  development  team assesses each scenario and             breaks it  down into  tasks. For example, some of the task cards developed from  the             story card for prescribing  medication (Figure 3.5) are shown in Figure 3.6. Each task             generates one or more unit tests that check the implementation described in that task.             Figure 3.7 is  a shortened description of a test case that has been developed to check             that the prescribed dose of a drug does not fall outside known safe limits.8770 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                             Test 4: Dose Checking                                            Input:                                            1.  A number in mg representing a single dose of the drug.                                            2.  A number representing the number of single doses per day.                                            Tests:                                            1.

Test for inputs where the single dose is too high and too low.                                            3.   Test for inputs where the single dose × frequency is too high and too low.                                            4.

As I dis-                                   cuss in Chapter 8, acceptance testing is the process where the system is tested using                                   customer data to check that it meets the customer’s real needs.                                       In  XP, acceptance testing, like development, is incremental. The customer who is                                   part of the team writes tests as development proceeds. All new code is therefore val-                                   idated to ensure that it  is what  the customer needs. For the story in  Figure 3.5,  the                                   acceptance test would involve scenarios where (a) the dose of  a drug was changed,                                   (b) a new drug was selected, and (c) the formulary  was used to find a drug. In prac-                                   tice, a series of acceptance tests rather than a single test are normally required.                                       Relying  on  the customer to support acceptance test development is sometimes a                                   major difficulty   in  the XP  testing process. People adopting the customer role  have                                   very limited  available time  and may not be able to work  full-time  with  the develop-                                   ment team. The customer may feel that providing  the requirements was enough of a                                   contribution  and so may be reluctant to get involved in the testing process.                                       Test automation is essential for test-first development. Tests are written as executable                                   components before the task is implemented. These testing components should be stand-                                   alone, should simulate the submission of input to be tested, and should check that the                                   result meets the output specification.  An automated test framework  is a system that                                   makes it easy to write  executable tests and submit a set of tests for execution. Junit                                   (Massol and Husted, 2003) is a widely used example of an automated testing framework.                                       As  testing is automated, there is always a set of tests that can be quickly and eas-                                   ily executed. Whenever any functionality  is added to the system, the tests can be run                                   and problems that the new code has introduced can be caught immediately.                                       Test-first  development and automated testing usually results in a large number of                                   tests being written and executed. However, this approach does not necessarily lead to                                   thorough program testing. There are three reasons for this:                                   1. Programmers    prefer programming  to testing and sometimes they take shortcuts                                          when writing   tests. For example,  they may  write  incomplete tests that  do not                                          check for all  possible exceptions that may occur.88                                                                                          3.3 \\x02 Extreme    programming 71              2. Some    tests can be very difficult  to write  incrementally.  For example, in a com-                     plex user interface, it is often difficult   to write  unit tests for the code that imple-                     ments the ‘display logic’  and workflow   between screens.              3. It    difficult   to judge the completeness of a set of tests. Although you may have a                     lot  of system tests, your  test set may  not provide  complete  coverage. Crucial                     parts of the system may not be executed and so remain untested.                  Therefore,  although a large set of frequently  executed tests may give the impres-              sion that the system is complete and correct, this may not be the case. If the tests are              not reviewed and further  tests written after development, then undetected bugs may              be delivered in the system release.3.3.2 Pair       programming              Another  innovative  practice  that has been introduced  in  XP  is that  programmers              work in pairs to develop the software. They actually sit together at the same worksta-              tion  to  develop  the software.   However,  the same  pairs  do not  always  program              together. Rather, pairs are created dynamically so that all  team members work with              each other during the development process.                  The use of pair  programming has a number of advantages:              1. It     supports the idea of  collective  ownership and responsibility   for  the system.                     This  reflects Weinberg’s  (1971) idea of  egoless programming  where the  soft-                     ware is owned by  the team as a whole and individuals  are not held responsible                     for  problems with  the code. Instead, the  team has collective responsibility   for                     resolving these problems.              2. It    acts as an informal review process because each line of code is looked at by at                     least two people. Code inspections and reviews (covered in Chapter 24) are very                     successful in discovering  a high  percentage of software  errors. However, they                     are time consuming  to organize and, typically,  introduce delays into  the devel-                     opment process. Although pair programming  is a less formal process that prob-                     ably  doesn’t  find  as many  errors  as code inspections,   it  is a much  cheaper                     inspection process than formal program inspections.              3. It    helps support refactoring, which is a process of software improvement. The diffi-                     culty of  implementing this in  a normal development environment is that effort in                     refactoring is expended for long-term benefit. An individual  who practices refac-                     toring may be judged to be less efficient than one who simply carries on developing                     code. Where pair programming and collective ownership are used, others benefit                     immediately from the refactoring so they are likely to support the process.                  You might  think that pair programming would be less efficient than individual pro-              gramming. In a given time, a pair of  developers would produce half as much code as8972 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                   two individuals  working alone. There have been various studies of the productivity of                                   paid programmers with   mixed results. Using  student volunteers,  Williams  and her                                   collaborators (Cockburn and Williams,   2001; Williams  et al., 2000)  found that pro-                                   ductivity  with  pair  programming  seems to be comparable with   that of  two people                                   working  independently.  The reasons suggested are that pairs discuss the  software                                   before development so probably have fewer false starts and less rework. Furthermore,                                   the number of errors avoided by the informal inspection is such that less time is spent                                   repairing bugs discovered during the testing process.                                        However, studies with   more experienced programmers  (Arisholm   et al.,  2007;                                   Parrish et al., 2004) did not replicate these results. They found that there was a signifi-                                   cant loss of productivity compared with two programmers working  alone. There were                                   some quality  benefits but these did not  fully  compensate for the pair-programming                                   overhead. Nevertheless, the sharing of knowledge that happens during pair program-                                   ming is very important as it reduces the overall risks to a project when team members                                   leave. In itself, this may make pair programming worthwhile.                       3.4 Agile             project          management                                   The principal responsibility  of software  project managers is to manage the project so                                   that the software is delivered on time  and within  the planned budget for the project.                                   They supervise the work  of  software engineers and monitor  how well  the software                                   development is progressing.                                        The standard approach  to project  management  is plan-driven.   As I  discuss in                                   Chapter 23, managers draw up a plan for the project showing  what should be deliv-                                   ered, when it should be delivered, and who will work on the development of the proj-                                   ect deliverables. A  plan-based approach really requires  a manager to have a stable                                   view  of   everything  that   has to  be  developed  and  the  development  processes.                                   However,  it  does not work   well  with  agile  methods  where the  requirements  are                                   developed incrementally; where the software is delivered  in short, rapid increments;                                   and where changes to the requirements and the software are the norm.                                        Like every  other professional software  development process, agile development                                   has to be managed so that the best use is made of the time and resources available to                                   the team.  This  requires  a  different   approach  to  project  management,  which  is                                   adapted to incremental development and the particular strengths of agile methods.                                        The Scrum approach (Schwaber, 2004; Schwaber and Beedle, 2001) is a general                                   agile method but its focus  is on managing iterative development rather than specific                                   technical approaches to agile software engineering. Figure 3.8 is a diagram of the Scrum                                   management process. Scrum does not prescribe the use of programming practices such                                   as pair programming and test-first development. It can therefore be used with more tech-                                   nical agile approaches, such as XP, to provide a management framework for the project.                                        There are three phases in Scrum. The first is an outline planning phase where you                                   establish the general objectives for the project  and design the software architecture.90                                                                                                         3.4 \\x02 Agile   project  management 73                                                                                         Assess Select                                             Outline Planning                                             and Architectural                                                               Project Closure                                                    Design                                                                                         Review DevelopFigure 3.8 The Scrumprocess                                                                                Sprint Cycle                                   This is followed  by a series of sprint cycles, where each cycle develops an increment                                   of the  system. Finally,  the  project  closure phase wraps up  the project,  completes                                   required documentation such as system help frames and user manuals, and assesses                                   the lessons learned from the project.                                        The innovative  feature of  Scrum  is its  central phase, namely  the sprint  cycles.                                   A Scrum sprint  is a planning unit  in which  the work to be done is assessed, features                                   are selected for  development,  and  the software  is  implemented.  At  the  end of  a                                   sprint, the completed  functionality  is  delivered to  stakeholders. Key characteristics                                   of this process are as follows:                                   1. Sprints    are fixed  length, normally  2–4 weeks. They correspond to  the develop-                                          ment of a release of the system in XP.                                   2. The    starting point  for planning  is the product backlog, which  is the list  of work                                          to be  done on the  project.  During  the assessment phase of the  sprint,  this  is                                          reviewed, and priorities and risks are assigned. The customer is closely involved                                          in this  process and can introduce new requirements or tasks at the beginning of                                          each sprint.                                   3. The    selection phase involves all of the project team who work with the customer                                          to select the features and functionality to  be developed during the sprint.                                   4. Once    these are agreed, the team organizes themselves to develop the software.                                          Short daily  meetings  involving  all  team members are held  to review  progress                                          and if  necessary, reprioritize work.  During  this stage the team is isolated  from                                          the customer and the organization, with all  communications channelled through                                          the so-called  ‘Scrum  master’.  The role  of  the Scrum  master is to  protect the                                          development  team from  external  distractions.  The way  in  which  the work  is                                          done depends on the problem  and the team. Unlike  XP, Scrum does not  make                                          specific  suggestions on how to  write requirements,  test-first development,  etc.                                          However, these XP practices can be used if the team thinks they are appropriate.                                   5. At    the end of the sprint, the work done is reviewed and presented to stakeholders.                                          The next sprint cycle then begins.                                        The idea behind  Scrum  is that the  whole  team should  be empowered to  make                                   decisions so the term ‘project  manager’,  has been deliberately avoided. Rather, the9174 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                   ‘Scrum  master’ is  a facilitator  who  arranges daily meetings,  tracks the backlog  of                                   work to be done, records decisions, measures progress against the backlog, and com-                                   municates with customers and management outside of the team.                                       The  whole  team  attends the daily   meetings, which   are sometimes  ‘stand-up’                                   meetings to  keep them short  and focused. During  the  meeting, all  team members                                   share information, describe their progress since the last meeting, problems that have                                   arisen, and what is planned for  the following   day. This means that everyone on the                                   team knows what is  going on and, if  problems arise, can replan short-term  work  to                                   cope with them.  Everyone participates in this  short-term planning—there  is no top-                                   down direction from  the Scrum master.                                       There are many anecdotal reports of the successful use of Scrum available on the                                   Web. Rising  and Janoff  (2000) discuss  its successful use in  a telecommunication                                   software development environment, and they list its advantages as follows:                                   1. The     product  is  broken  down  into  a set  of  manageable and  understandable                                          chunks.                                   2. Unstable    requirements do not hold up progress.                                   3. The    whole team has visibility  of everything and consequently team communica-                                          tion is improved.                                   4. Customers    see on-time  delivery  of  increments and gain  feedback on how  the                                          product works.                                   5. Trust    between customers and developers is established and a positive culture is                                          created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.                                       Scrum,  as originally designed, was intended for use with  co-located teams where                                   all  team members could  get  together  every day  in stand-up  meetings.  However,                                   much software  development  now  involves  distributed  teams with  team  members                                   located in different  places around the world. Consequently, there are various experi-                                   ments going on to develop Scrum  for distributed  development environments (Smits                                   and Pshigoda, 2007; Sutherland et al., 2007).                       3.5 Scaling                agile       methods                                   Agile  methods  were developed  for  use by small  programming   teams who  could                                   work  together in the same room and communicate  informally.  Agile  methods have                                   therefore been mostly used for the development of small and medium-sized systems.                                   Of course, the need for faster delivery of software, which  is more suited to customer                                   needs, also applies to larger  systems. Consequently, there has been a great deal of                                   interest in  scaling  agile methods to  cope with  larger  systems, developed by  large                                   organizations.92                                                                            3.5 \\x02 Scaling    agile methods 75    Denning et al. (2008) argue that the only way to avoid common software engineer-ing problems, such as systems that don’t meet customer needs and budget overruns, isto find ways of making agile methods work for large systems. Leffingwell (2007) dis-cusses which agile practices scale to large systems development. Moore  and Spens(2008) report on their experience of using an agile approach to develop a large med-ical system with 300 developers working in geographically distributed  teams.    Large  software system development is different  from  small system developmentin a number of ways:1. Large    systems  are usually  collections   of  separate, communicating   systems,       where separate teams develop each system. Frequently, these teams are working       in different  places, sometimes in different  time zones. It is  practically  impossi-       ble for each team to have a view of the whole system. Consequently, their prior-       ities are usually  to complete  their part  of the  system without  regard for  wider       systems issues.2. Large    systems are ‘brownfield   systems’  (Hopkins  and Jenkins,  2008); that  is       they include and interact with a number of existing systems. Many of the system       requirements are concerned with this interaction  and so don’t really  lend them-       selves to flexibility    and incremental development.  Political  issues can also be       significant here—often  the easiest solution to a problem is to change an existing       system. However, this requires negotiation with  the managers of that system to       convince them that the changes can be implemented without risk to the system’s       operation.3. Where    several systems are integrated to create a system, a significant fraction of       the development  is concerned with   system configuration  rather  than original       code development. This is not necessarily compatible with incremental develop-       ment and frequent system integration.4. Large    systems and their development processes are often constrained by exter-       nal rules  and  regulations  limiting   the  way  that they  can be  developed,  that       require certain types of system documentation to be produced, etc.5. Large    systems have a long procurement and development time. It is  difficult  to       maintain  coherent  teams  who  know  about  the  system over  that  period   as,       inevitably, people move on to other jobs and projects.6. Large   systems usually have a diverse set of stakeholders. For example, nurses and       administrators may be the end-users of a medical system but senior medical staff,       hospital managers, etc. are also stakeholders in the system. It is practically impos-       sible to involve all of these different stakeholders in the development process.    There are two perspectives on the scaling of agile methods:1. A     ‘scaling  up’  perspective, which  is concerned  with  using these methods for       developing large software systems that cannot be developed by a small team.9376 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development                                   2. A    ‘scaling  out’  perspective, which is concerned with  how agile methods can be                                          introduced across a large organization with many years of software development                                          experience.                                        Agile  methods  have  to  be adapted  to  cope with   large  systems engineering.                                   Leffingwell   (2007) argues that it  is essential to maintain  the fundamentals of  agile                                   methods—flexible  planning,  frequent system releases, continuous integration,  test-                                   driven development, and good team communications. I believe that the critical adap-                                   tations that have to be introduced are as follows:                                   1. For    large systems development, it is not possible to focus only on the code of the                                          system. You need to  do more up-front  design and system documentation.  The                                          software architecture has to be designed and there has to be documentation pro-                                          duced to describe critical  aspects of the system, such as database schemas, the                                          work breakdown  across teams, etc.                                   2. Cross-team    communication   mechanisms have to  be designed and  used. This                                          should involve regular phone and video conferences between team members and                                          frequent, short electronic  meetings where teams update each other on progress.                                          Arange  of  communication  channels such as e-mail,  instant messaging, wikis,                                          and social networking systems should be provided to facilitate communications.                                   3. Continuous    integration,  where the whole  system is built  every time  any devel-                                          oper checks in  a change, is practically   impossible  when several separate pro-                                          grams have to  be integrated  to create  the system. However,  it  is essential  to                                          maintain  frequent system builds  and regular  releases of the system. This  may                                          mean that new  configuration  management tools  that support  multi-team  soft-                                          ware development have to be introduced.                                        Small software companies that develop software products have been amongst the                                   most enthusiastic adopters of agile methods. These companies are not constrained by                                   organizational  bureaucracies or process standards and they can change quickly   to                                   adopt new  ideas. Of course,  larger companies  have also experimented  with  agile                                   methods in  specific  projects, but  it is  much more  difficult   for  them to  ‘scale out’                                   these methods across the organization.  Lindvall,  et al.  (2004) discuss some of  the                                   problems in scaling-out agile  methods in four large technology companies.                                        It is  difficult   to introduce  agile  methods into  large companies  for a  number of                                   reasons:                                   1. Project    managers who do not have experience of agile methods may be reluctant                                          to accept the risk  of a new  approach, as they do not know  how this  will  affect                                          their particular  projects.                                   2. Large    organizations often have quality procedures and standards that all projects                                          are expected to follow and, because of their bureaucratic nature, these are likely to                                          be incompatible with agile methods. Sometimes, these are supported by software94                                                                                                                      Chapter 3 \\x02 Key   points 77                                        tools (e.g., requirements management tools) and the use of these tools is mandated                                        for all projects.                                 3. Agile     methods seem to  work best when  team members have a relatively  high                                        skill  level.  However, within   large organizations,  there are likely   to be a  wide                                        range of skills and abilities,  and people with lower skill  levels may not be effec-                                        tive team members in agile processes.                                 4. There   may be cultural resistance to agile methods, especially in those organizations                                        that have a long history of using conventional systems engineering processes.                                      Change management and testing  procedures are examples  of company  proce-                                 dures that may  not be compatible  with  agile  methods. Change management is the                                 process of controlling   changes to  a system, so that  the impact  of  changes is pre-                                 dictable and costs are controlled. All changes have to be approved in advance before                                 they are made and this conflicts with  the notion of refactoring.  In XP, any developer                                 can improve any code without getting external approval. For large systems, there are                                 also testing  standards where a system  build  is handed over  to an external  testing                                 team. This may conflict  with  the test-first and test-often approaches used in XP.                                      Introducing and sustaining the use of agile methods across a large organization is                                 a process of cultural  change. Cultural  change takes a long  time  to implement  and                                 often requires a change of  management before it can be accomplished. Companies                                 wishing to use agile methods need evangelists to promote change. They must devote                                 significant resources to the change process. At the time of writing,  few large compa-                                 nies have made a successful transition to agile development across the organization.KEY     POINTS     \\x02 Agile   methods are incremental development methods that  focus on rapid development, frequent           releases of the software, reducing process overheads, and producing high-quality code. They           involve the customer directly in the development  process.     \\x02 The   decision on whether to use an agile or a plan-driven approach to development should           depend on the type of software being developed, the capabilities  of the development team, and           the culture of the company developing the system.     \\x02 Extreme   programming is a well-known agile method that  integrates a range of good           programming practices such as frequent releases of the software, continuous software           improvement, and customer participation  in the development team.     \\x02 A   particular strength  of extreme programming is the development of automated tests before a           program feature is created. All tests must successfully execute when an increment is integrated           into a system.9578 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  development       \\x02 The   Scrum method is an agile method that provides a project management framework. It is             centered around a set of sprints, which are fixed time periods when a system increment is             developed. Planning is based on prioritizing a backlog of work and selecting the highest-             priority tasks  for a sprint.       \\x02 Scaling   agile methods for large systems is difficult.  Large systems need up-front design and             some documentation. Continuous integration  is practically impossible when there are several             separate development teams working on a project.FURTHER      READING       Extreme Programming Explained. This was the first book on XP and is still, perhaps, the most       readable. It explains the approach from the perspective of one of its inventors and his       enthusiasm comes through very clearly in the book.

Collect  the requirements for such a system from software engineers and external              stakeholders (such as the regulatory certification  authority)  and develop the system              using a plan-driven approach.         b. Develop  a prototype using a scripting language, such as Ruby or Python, evaluate               this prototype  with software engineers and other stakeholders,  then review the               system requirements. Redevelop the final system using Java.         c. Develop  the system in Java using an agile approach with a user involved in the              development team.  3.9. It has been suggested that one of the problems of having a user closely involved with          a software development team is that they ‘go native’;  that is, they adopt the outlook  of          the development team and lose sight of the needs of their  user colleagues. Suggest three         ways how you might avoid this problem and discuss the advantages and disadvantages          of each approach.3.10. To reduce costs and the environmental  impact of commuting,  your company decides  to         close a number of offices  and to provide  support for  staff to work  from home. However,         the senior  management who introduce  the policy  are unaware that software  is developed         using agile  methods, which  rely on close team working  and pair programming.  Discuss         the difficulties   that this  new policy might  cause and how you might get  around these         problems.9780 Chapter    3 \\x02 Agile    software  developmentREFERENCES       Ambler, S.

When you have read the chapter you will:            \\x02 understand the concepts of user and system requirements and                why these requirements should be written in different ways;            \\x02 understand the differences between functional and nonfunctional                software requirements;            \\x02 understand how requirements may be organized in a software                requirements document;            \\x02 understand the principal requirements engineering activities of                elicitation, analysis and validation, and the relationships between                these activities;            \\x02 understand why requirements management is necessary and how                it supports other requirements engineering activities.

These requirementsreflect the needs of customers for a system that serves a certain purpose such as con-trolling  a device,  placing an  order, or finding   information.  The  process of findingout, analyzing,  documenting  and checking these services and constraints  is calledrequirements engineering (RE).    The term  ‘requirement’  is not used consistently in the software industry.  In somecases, a requirement is simply a high-level, abstract statement of a service that a sys-tem should provide or a constraint on a system. At the other extreme, it is a detailed,formal definition  of  a system function. Davis (1993)  explains why these differencesexist:    If  a company wishes to let a contract for a large software development project,    it  must define its needs in a sufficiently abstract way that a solution  is not pre-    defined. The requirements must be written  so that several contractors can  bid    for  the contract, offering,  perhaps, different ways of meeting the client organi-    zation’s  needs. Once a contract has been awarded, the contractor must write a    system definition for the client  in more detail so that the client understands and    can validate  what the software will  do. Both of these documents may be called    the requirements document for the system.    Some of the problems  that arise during the requirements engineering process area result  of  failing   to  make a  clear separation  between  these different   levels  ofdescription.  I distinguish   between them by  using  the term ‘user  requirements’  tomean the high-level  abstract requirements and  ‘system requirements’  to  mean thedetailed description  of  what the system  should do. User  requirements and systemrequirements may be defined as follows:1. User    requirements are statements, in a natural language plus diagrams, of what       services the system is expected to  provide to  system users and the constraints       under which it  must operate.2. System    requirements  are more detailed  descriptions of  the software  system’s       functions, services, and operational constraints. The system requirements docu-       ment (sometimes called a functional specification) should define exactly what  is       to be implemented. It may be part of the contract between the system buyer and       the software developers.    Different   levels of  requirements are useful because they communicate informa-tion about the system to different types of reader. Figure 4.1 illustrates the distinctionbetween user and system  requirements.  This  example from  a mental  health  carepatient management system  (MHC-PMS)   shows how  a user requirement  may beexpanded into several system  requirements. You  can see from Figure  4.1 that  theuser requirement is  quite general. The  system requirements provide  more specificinformation about the services and functions of the system that is to be implemented.10184 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements    engineering                                              User Requirement Definition                                                1.

Figure 4.2 shows possible readers of the user and sys-                                   tem requirements. The  readers of the user requirements  are not usually  concerned                                   with  how the system will  be implemented  and may be managers who are not inter-                                   ested in the detailed facilities of  the system. The readers of the system requirements                                   need to know  more precisely  what the system will   do because they are concerned                                   with  how it  will  support the business processes or because they are involved in the                                   system implementation.                                        In  this chapter, I present a ‘traditional’   view  of requirements rather than require-                                   ments in agile  processes. For most large systems, it  is still   the case that there is a                                   clearly  identifiable  requirements  engineering  phase before the implementation   of                                    the system begins. The outcome is a requirements document, which may be part of the                                   system development contract.  Of  course, there are usually  subsequent changes to                                    the requirements and user requirements may be expanded into more detailed system                                   requirements.  However, the  agile approach  of  concurrently  eliciting   the  require-                                   ments as the system is developed is rarely used for large systems development.                       4.1 Functional                   and     non-functional                  requirements                                   Software system requirements are often classified as functional requirements or non-                                   functional  requirements:                                   1.

In  some cases, the functional  require-                                          ments may also explicitly  state what the system should not do.                                   2. Non-functional     requirements These are constraints on the services or functions                                          offered by the system. They include timing  constraints, constraints on the devel-                                          opment process, and constraints imposed by standards. Non-functional require-                                          ments  often  apply  to the  system  as a whole,  rather  than  individual   system                                          features or services.                                        In reality, the distinction between different  types of requirement is not as clear-cut                                   as these simple definitions   suggest. A  user requirement  concerned with   security,                                   such as a statement limiting   access to authorized  users, may  appear to be a non-                                   functional  requirement. However, when  developed in more  detail, this  requirement                                   may generate other  requirements  that are  clearly  functional,   such as the need to                                   include user authentication facilities  in the system.                                        This shows that requirements are not independent and that one requirement often                                   generates or constrains other requirements. The system requirements therefore do not                                   just specify the services or the features of the system that are required; they also specify                                   the necessary functionality to ensure that these services/features are delivered properly.                      4.1.1 Functional         requirements                                   The functional requirements for  a system describe what the system should do. These                                   requirements depend on the type of software being developed, the expected users of                                   the software,  and  the general  approach  taken by  the organization   when  writing                                   requirements. When  expressed as user requirements,  functional  requirements  are                                   usually  described  in  an  abstract  way  that  can be  understood  by  system  users.                                   However, more  specific functional  system  requirements describe the system func-                                   tions, its inputs and outputs, exceptions, etc., in detail.                                        Functional system  requirements vary  from general  requirements covering  what                                   the system should do to very specific requirements reflecting  local ways of  working                                   or an organization’s existing  systems. For example, here are examples of functional10386 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements    engineering       FPO Domain    requirements    Domain requirements are derived from the application domain of the system rather than from the specific    needs of system users. They may be new functional requirements in their own right, constrain existing    functional requirements, or set out how particular computations must be carried out.        The problem with domain requirements is that software engineers may not understand the characteristics of    the domain in which the system operates. They often cannot tell whether or not a domain requirement has    been missed out or conflicts with other requirements.                          http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/DomainReq.html                                   requirements for the MHC-PMS  system, used to maintain information about patients                                   receiving treatment for mental  health problems:                                   1. A    user shall be able to search the appointments lists for all clinics.                                   2. The    system shall  generate each day, for each clinic,  a list  of  patients who  are                                          expected to attend appointments that day.                                   3. Each    staff member  using the system shall  be uniquely  identified  by his or  her                                          eight-digit  employee number.                                       These functional  user requirements define specific facilities to be provided by  the                                   system. These have been taken from the user requirements document and they show                                   that functional   requirements may  be written  at  different  levels  of detail  (contrast                                   requirements 1 and 3).                                       Imprecision  in the requirements specification  is the cause of many software engi-                                   neering problems.  It  is  natural for  a system  developer to  interpret  an ambiguous                                   requirement in a way  that simplifies  its implementation.  Often,  however, this is not                                   what the  customer wants.  New requirements  have to  be established  and changes                                   made to the system. Of course, this delays system delivery and increases costs.                                       For example, the first example requirement for the MHC-PMS states that a user shall                                   be able to search the appointments lists for all clinics. The rationale for this requirement                                   is that patients with mental health problems are sometimes confused. They may have an                                   appointment at one clinic but actually go to a different clinic.  If they have an appoint-                                   ment, they will be recorded as having attended, irrespective of the clinic.                                       The medical  staff member specifying this may expect ‘search’ to mean that, given                                   a patient  name, the system looks  for  that name  in all  appointments  at all  clinics.                                   However, this is not explicit  in the requirement. System developers may interpret the                                   requirement in  a different  way and may implement  a search so that the user has to                                   choose a clinic then carry out the search. This obviously will involve  more user input                                   and so take longer.                                       In  principle,  the functional requirements specification of  a system should be both                                   complete and consistent. Completeness means that all services required by the user                                   should be defined. Consistency means that requirements should not have contradictory104                                                      4.1 \\x02 Functional    and non-functional   requirements 87             definitions.   In practice,  for  large, complex  systems, it  is practically   impossible to             achieve requirements consistency and completeness. One reason for this is that it is easy             to  make mistakes and omissions when writing   specifications for  complex  systems.             Another reason is that there are many stakeholders in a large system. A stakeholder is a             person or role that is affected by the system in some way. Stakeholders have different—             and often  inconsistent—needs. These inconsistencies may not be obvious when the             requirements are first specified, so inconsistent requirements are included in the specifi-             cation. The  problems may only emerge after deeper analysis or after the system has             been delivered to the customer.4.1.2 Non-functional            requirements             Non-functional   requirements,  as the name suggests, are requirements that  are not             directly   concerned with  the specific  services delivered  by the  system to its  users.             They may relate to emergent system properties such as reliability, response time, and             store occupancy. Alternatively, they may define constraints on the system implemen-             tation such as the capabilities of I/O devices or the data representations used in inter-             faces with  other systems.                  Non-functional  requirements, such as performance, security, or availability, usually             specify or  constrain characteristics of the system as a whole. Non-functional require-             ments are often more critical than individual functional requirements. System users can             usually find ways to work around a system function that doesn’t really meet their needs.             However, failing to meet a non-functional requirement can mean that the whole system             is unusable. For example, if an aircraft system does not meet its reliability requirements,             it will  not be certified as safe for operation; if an embedded control system fails to meet             its performance requirements, the control functions will not operate correctly.                  Although   it is  often possible  to identify   which  system components  implement             specific  functional   requirements  (e.g.,  there may be  formatting   components that             implement  reporting requirements), it  is often more difficult  to relate components to             non-functional  requirements. The implementation  of these requirements may be dif-             fused throughout the system. There are two reasons for this:             1. Non-functional       requirements may  affect  the overall  architecture  of  a system                    rather than the individual  components. For example, to ensure that performance                    requirements  are met, you may have to  organize the system to minimize  com-                    munications  between components.             2. A     single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate                    a number of  related functional requirements that define new system services that                    are required. In  addition, it  may also generate requirements that restrict existing                    requirements.                  Non-functional   requirements arise  through user needs, because of budget  con-             straints, organizational  policies, the need for  interoperability  with  other software or10588 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements    engineering                                                                                       Non-Functional                                                                                        Requirements                                                  Product                          Organizational                      External                                               Requirements                   Requirements                   Requirements                       Efficiency        Dependability         Security                Regulatory           Ethical                    Requirements    Requirements    Requirements        Requirements     Requirements        Usability                                        Environmental     Operational       Development           Legislative     Requirements                                  Requirements     Requirements    Requirements        Requirements        Performance          Space                                                                        Accounting      Safety/Security       Requirements    Requirements                                                               Requirements    Requirements                                   hardware systems, or external factors  such as safety regulations or privacy  legisla-Figure 4.3 Types ofnon-functional            tion.  Figure 4.3 is a classification of  non-functional  requirements. You can see fromrequirement               this  diagram that the non-functional  requirements  may come from  required charac-                                   teristics of the software (product requirements), the organization developing the soft-                                   ware (organizational requirements), or from  external sources:                                   1. Product    requirements These requirements specify or constrain the behavior of the                                          software. Examples  include performance requirements on  how fast the  system                                          must execute and how much memory it requires, reliability  requirements that set                                          out the acceptable failure rate, security requirements, and usability requirements.                                   2. Organizational     requirements These requirements are broad system requirements                                          derived from policies and procedures in the customer’s and developer’s organiza-                                          tion. Examples include operational process requirements that define how the sys-                                          tem will  be used, development process requirements that specify the programming                                          language, the development environment or process standards to be used, and envi-                                          ronmental requirements that specify the operating environment of the system.                                   3. External      requirements This   broad heading  covers  all  requirements  that  are                                          derived from  factors external to the system and its development process. These                                          may include regulatory  requirements that set out what must be done for the sys-                                          tem to  be approved for  use by a  regulator, such as a central  bank; legislative                                          requirements that must be followed to ensure that the system operates within the                                          law;  and ethical requirements that ensure that the system will   be acceptable to                                          its users and the general public.106                                                                           4.1 \\x02 Functional    and non-functional   requirements 89    PRODUCT REQUIREMENT    The MHC-PMS shall be available to all clinics during normal working hours (Mon–Fri, 08.30–17.30). Downtime    within normal working hours shall not exceed five seconds in any one day.    ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENT    Users of the MHC-PMS system shall authenticate themselves using their health authority identity card.    EXTERNAL REQUIREMENT    The system shall implement patient privacy provisions as set out in HStan-03-2006-priv.                                        Figure 4.4 shows examples of product, organizational, and external requirementsFigure 4.4 Examplesof non-functional        taken from the MHC-PMS  whose user requirements were introduced in Section 4.1.1.requirements in the The    product requirement is an availability  requirement that defines when the systemMHC-PMS                  has to be available and the allowed  down  time each day. It  says nothing about the                                   functionality  of  MHC-PMS  and clearly identifies  a constraint that has to be consid-                                   ered by the system designers.                                        The organizational requirement specifies how users authenticate themselves to the                                   system. The health authority that operates the system is moving to a standard authenti-                                   cation procedure for  all software where,  instead of users having a login  name, they                                   swipe their identity card through a reader to identify themselves. The external require-                                   ment is derived from the need for the system to conform to privacy legislation. Privacy                                   is obviously a very important issue in healthcare systems and the requirement specifies                                   that the system should be developed in accordance with a national privacy standard.                                        A common problem  with  non-functional  requirements is that users or customers                                   often propose these requirements as general goals, such as ease of use, the ability of                                   the system to recover from failure,  or rapid user response. Goals set out good inten-                                   tions but cause problems for system developers as they leave scope for interpretation                                   and subsequent dispute once the system is delivered. For example, the following sys-                                   tem goal is typical  of how a manager might express usability requirements:                                        The system should be easy to use by medical staff and should be organized in                                        such a way that user errors are minimized.                                        I have rewritten this to show how the goal could  be expressed as a ‘testable’ non-                                   functional  requirement. It is  impossible to objectively  verify  the system goal, but in                                   the description below you  can at least include software instrumentation to  count the                                   errors made by users when they are testing the system.                                        Medical staff  shall be able  to use all  the system functions after four  hours of                                        training.  After  this  training,  the  average number  of errors  made by  experi-                                        enced users shall not exceed two per hour of system use.                                        Whenever possible, you should write  non-functional  requirements quantitatively                                   so that they can be objectively  tested.

For some goals, such as maintainability, there are no                                   metrics that can be used. In other cases, even when quantitative specification is pos-                                   sible, customers may not  be able to relate their  needs to these specifications. They                                   don’t understand what some number defining  the required reliability  (say) means in                                   terms of their everyday experience with  computer systems. Furthermore, the cost of                                   objectively  verifying  measurable, non-functional requirements can be very high and                                   the customers paying for the system may not think these costs are justified.                                       Non-functional    requirements  often  conflict  and  interact  with  other functional                                   or non-functional   requirements.   For example,  the  authentication  requirement  in                                   Figure  4.4 obviously   requires  a card  reader to  be installed   with  each computer                                   attached to the  system. However, there  may be another  requirement that  requests                                   mobile access to the system from doctors’ or nurses’ laptops. These are not normally                                   equipped with  card readers so, in these circumstances, some alternative authentica-                                   tion method may have to be allowed.                                       It  is difficult,   in practice,  to separate functional and non-functional  requirements                                   in the  requirements document. If  the  non-functional  requirements are stated sepa-                                   rately from the functional  requirements, the relationships between them may be hard                                   to understand. However, you should explicitly highlight  requirements that are clearly                                   related to emergent system properties, such as performance or reliability. You can do                                   this by putting them in  a separate section of the requirements document or by distin-                                   guishing them, in some way, from  other system requirements.108                                                                                 4.2 \\x02 The   software  requirements  document 91  FPO Requirements   document standardsA number of large organizations, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and the IEEE, have defined standardsfor requirements documents. These are usually very generic but are nevertheless useful as a basis fordeveloping more detailed organizational standards. The U.S. Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers(IEEE) is one of the best-known standards providers and they have developed a standard for the structure ofrequirements documents. This standard is most appropriate for systems such as military command and controlsystems that have a long lifetime and are usually developed by a group of organizations.                   http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/IEEE-standard.html                                  Non-functional     requirements  such  as  reliability,    safety,  and confidentiality                              requirements are particularly   important  for critical   systems. I cover  these require-                              ments in Chapter 12, where I describe specific techniques for specifying dependabil-                              ity and security requirements.                 4.2 The            software           requirements                document                              The software requirements  document (sometimes called the  software requirements                              specification or  SRS) is an official  statement of  what the system developers should                              implement. It  should include both  the user requirements for a system and a detailed                              specification  of the system requirements.  Sometimes, the user and system require-                              ments are integrated into a single  description. In  other cases, the user requirements                              are defined in an introduction to the system requirements specification. If  there are a                              large number of requirements, the detailed system requirements may be presented in                              a separate document.                                  Requirements  documents are essential when an outside contractor is developing                              the software system. However, agile  development methods argue that requirements                              change so rapidly that a requirements document is out of date as soon as it is written,                              so the effort  is largely  wasted. Rather than a formal  document, approaches such as                              Extreme Programming   (Beck, 1999)  collect  user requirements  incrementally  and                              write these on cards as user stories. The user then prioritizes requirements for imple-                              mentation in the next increment of  the system.                                  For  business systems where requirements are unstable, I think that this approach                              is a good one. However, I think that it is still  useful to write  a short supporting docu-                              ment that defines the  business and dependability requirements for  the system; it  is                              easy to forget the requirements that apply to the system as a whole when focusing on                              the functional requirements for  the next system release.                                  The  requirements document  has a diverse set of users, ranging  from  the senior                              management of  the  organization   that is  paying  for  the  system to  the  engineers                              responsible for developing the software.

Information  on  anticipated changes can help sys-                                   tem designers avoid restrictive design decisions and help system maintenance engi-                                   neers who have to adapt the system to new requirements.                                       The level of  detail that you should include in a requirements document depends on                                   the type of system that is being developed and the development process used. Critical                                   systems need to have detailed requirements because safety and security have to be ana-                                   lyzed in  detail.  When the  system is to  be developed by a  separate company (e.g.,                                   through outsourcing), the system specifications need to be detailed and precise. If an in-                                   house, iterative development process is used, the requirements document can be much                                   less detailed and any ambiguities can be resolved during development of the system.                                       Figure  4.7 shows one possible organization  for  a requirements document that is                                   based on an IEEE standard for requirements documents (IEEE, 1998). This standard                                   is a  generic  standard  that can  be adapted  to  specific  uses. In  this  case, I  have                                   extended the standard to include information about predicted system evolution. This                                   information  helps the maintainers of the system and allows designers to include sup-                                   port for future  system features.                                       Naturally,  the  information  that is  included in  a requirements document depends                                   on the type of software  being developed and the approach to development that is to                                   be used.

Examples of possible                                                             models are object models, data-flow models, or semantic data models.     System evolution                            This should describe the fundamental  assumptions on which  the system is                                                             based, and any anticipated changes due to hardware evolution, changing                                                             user needs, and so on. This section is useful for system designers as it may                                                             help them  avoid design decisions that would constrain likely future  changes                                                             to the system.     Appendices                                     These should provide detailed, specific information that is related to the                                                             application being developed; for example, hardware and database descriptions.                                                             Hardware requirements define the minimal and optimal configurations for the                                                             system. Database requirements define the logical organization of the data used                                                             by the system and the relationships between data.

In this  case,  the designers  and  programmers   use  their  judgmentdocument                       to  decide  how  to  meet  the outline   user  requirements    for  the system.                                             However,  when  the  software  is  part  of a large  system  project   that includes   interact-                                       ing  hardware   and software   systems,  it  is usually   necessary  to  define  the  requirements11194 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements    engineering       FPO Problems   with using natural language for requirements specification     The flexibility of natural language, which is so useful for specification, often causes problems. There is scope for     writing unclear requirements, and readers (the designers) may misinterpret requirements because they have a     different background to the user. It is easy to amalgamate several requirements into a single sentence and     structuring natural language requirements can be difficult.                         http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/NL-problems.html                                   to a fine level of  detail. This means that the requirements documents are likely to be                                   very long and should include most if  not all of  the chapters shown in Figure 4.7. For                                   long documents, it is particularly  important to include  a comprehensive table of con-                                   tents and document index so that readers can find the information that they need.                       4.3 Requirements                      specification                                   Requirements  specification   is the  process of  writing   down  the user  and system                                   requirements in a requirements document. Ideally, the user and system requirements                                   should be clear, unambiguous, easy to understand, complete, and consistent. In prac-                                   tice, this is difficult   to achieve as stakeholders interpret the requirements in different                                   ways and there are often inherent conflicts and inconsistencies in the requirements.                                       The  user  requirements  for  a system  should  describe the  functional   and non-                                   functional requirements so that they are understandable by system users who don’t have                                   detailed technical knowledge. Ideally, they should specify only the external behavior of                                   the system. The requirements document should not include details of the system archi-                                   tecture or design. Consequently, if you are writing user requirements, you should not                                   use software jargon, structured notations, or formal notations. You should write  user                                   requirements in natural language, with simple tables, forms, and intuitive diagrams.                                       System requirements are expanded versions of the user requirements that are used                                   by software engineers as the starting point for the system design. They add detail and                                   explain how the  user requirements should be provided by the system. They  may be                                   used as part of the contract for  the implementation  of the system and should there-                                   fore be a complete and detailed specification of the whole system.                                       Ideally,   the system requirements  should simply   describe the external  behavior                                    of the system and its operational constraints. They should not be concerned with how                                   the system  should  be designed  or implemented.   However,  at the  level  of  detail                                   required to completely  specify a complex software  system, it is practically  impossi-                                   ble to exclude all design information.  There are several reasons for this:                                   1. You    may have to design an initial architecture of the system to help structure the                                          requirements specification. The system requirements are organized according to112                                                                                                       4.3 \\x02 Requirements    specification 95    Notation                                          Description    Natural language sentences           The requirements are written using numbered sentences in natural                                                            language. Each sentence should express one requirement.    Structured natural language           The requirements are written in natural language on a standard form or                                                            template. Each field provides information about an aspect of the                                                            requirement.    Design description languages        This approach uses a language like a programming language, but with                                                            more abstract features to specify the requirements by defining an                                                            operational model of the system. This approach is now rarely used                                                            although it can be useful for interface specifications.    Graphical notations                         Graphical models, supplemented by text annotations, are used to define                                                            the functional requirements for the system; UML use case and sequence                                                            diagrams are commonly used.    Mathematical specifications            These notations are based on mathematical concepts such as finite-state                                                            machines or sets. Although these unambiguous specifications can reduce                                                            the ambiguity in a requirements document, most customers don’t                                                            understand a formal specification. They cannot check that it represents                                                            what they want and are reluctant to accept it as a system contract.                                          the different  sub-systems that make up the  system. As I  discuss in Chapters 6Figure 4.8 Ways ofwriting a system                and 18,  this architectural  definition   is essential if  you  want to  reuse softwarerequirements                     components when implementing  the system.specification                                   2. In    most cases, systems must interoperate with existing systems, which constrain                                          the design and impose requirements on the new system.                                   3. The    use of  a specific architecture  to satisfy non-functional   requirements (such                                          as N-version programming  to achieve reliability,  discussed in Chapter 13)  may                                          be necessary. An external regulator who needs to certify  that the system is safe                                          may specify that an already certified  architectural design be used.                                        User requirements are almost always  written  in natural  language supplemented                                   by  appropriate   diagrams   and  tables   in  the  requirements   document.    System                                   requirements may also be written  in  natural language but other  notations based on                                   forms,  graphical   system  models,  or  mathematical   system  models  can  also be                                   used. Figure 4.8 summarizes  the possible notations  that could  be used for writing                                   system requirements.                                        Graphical models are most useful when you need to show how a state changes or                                   when you  need to describe a sequence of actions. UML   sequence charts and state                                   charts, described in Chapter 5, show the sequence of actions that occur in  response                                   to a certain  message or event. Formal  mathematical  specifications  are sometimes                                   used to describe  the requirements  for safety-  or  security-critical   systems, but  are                                   rarely used in other circumstances. I  explain this approach to writing   specifications                                   in Chapter 12.11396 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements    engineering    3.2 The system shall measure the blood sugar and deliver insulin, if required, every 10 minutes. (Changes in    blood sugar are relatively slow so more frequent measurement is unnecessary; less frequent measurement    could lead to unnecessarily high sugar levels.)    3.6 The system shall run a self-test routine every minute with the conditions to be tested and the associated    actions defined in Table 1. (A self-test routine can discover hardware and software problems and alert the user    to the fact the normal operation may be impossible.)Figure 4.9 4.3.1 Natural             language     specificationExample requirements                                   Natural language has been used to write requirements for software since the beginningfor the insulin pumpsoftware system         of software engineering. It is expressive, intuitive, and universal. It is  also potentially                                   vague, ambiguous, and its meaning depends on the background of  the reader. As a                                   result, there have been many proposals for  alternative  ways to write  requirements.                                   However, none of these have been widely adopted and natural language will continue                                   to be the most widely used way of specifying system and software requirements.                                        To minimize   misunderstandings  when writing   natural  language requirements,                                   I recommend that you follow  some simple guidelines:                                   1. Invent    a  standard format and ensure that all  requirement  definitions  adhere to                                          that format.  Standardizing the format  makes omissions less likely  and require-                                          ments easier to check.  The format  I use expresses the requirement in  a single                                          sentence. I  associate a statement of  rationale  with   each user requirement  to                                          explain why  the requirement has been proposed. The rationale may also include                                          information  on who  proposed the requirement (the requirement source) so that                                          you know whom  to consult if  the requirement has to be changed.                                   2. Use    language  consistently   to distinguish   between  mandatory  and desirable                                          requirements. Mandatory  requirements  are requirements that the  system must                                          support and  are usually  written  using  ‘shall’.  Desirable  requirements  are not                                          essential and are written using ‘should’.                                   3. Use   text highlighting  (bold, italic, or color) to pick out key parts of the requirement.                                   4. Do    not assume that readers understand technical software engineering language.                                          It  is easy for words  like ‘architecture’   and ‘module’  to  be misunderstood. You                                          should, therefore, avoid the use of jargon, abbreviations, and acronyms.                                   5. Whenever     possible,  you  should  try  to  associate a  rationale  with   each user                                          requirement.   The  rationale  should   explain  why   the requirement   has  been                                          included. It  is particularly  useful when requirements are changed as it may help                                          decide what changes would be undesirable.                                        Figure 4.9 illustrates  how these guidelines may be used. It includes two  require-                                   ments for  the embedded software  for  the  automated insulin  pump,  introduced  in                                   Chapter 1. You can download the complete insulin pump  requirements specification                                   from the book’s web  pages.114                                                                                                       4.3 \\x02 Requirements    specification 97    Insulin Pump/Control Software/SRS/3.3.2    Function                 Compute insulin dose: Safe sugar level.

Inputs                     Current sugar reading (r2), the previous two readings (r0 and r1).    Source                   Current sugar reading from sensor. Other readings from memory.    Outputs                  CompDose—the dose in insulin to be delivered.    Destination             Main control loop.    Action                     CompDose is zero if the sugar level is stable or falling or if the level is increasing but the                                   rate of increase is decreasing. If the level is increasing and the rate of increase is                                   increasing, then CompDose is computed by dividing the difference between the current                                   sugar level and the previous level by 4 and rounding the result. If the result, is rounded to                                   zero then CompDose is set to the minimum dose that can be delivered.

This  approach maintains most of the expressiveness and understand-                                   ability   of natural   language but  ensures that  some uniformity    is imposed  on  the                                   specification.    Structured  language   notations  use  templates  to  specify   system                                   requirements.  The  specification   may  use programming    language constructs   to                                   show alternatives  and iteration,  and may highlight   key elements  using shading or                                   different  fonts.                                       The   Robertsons   (Robertson   and  Robertson,   1999),   in  their   book   on  the                                   VOLERE  requirements engineering method,  recommend that user requirements be                                   initially   written   on  cards, one requirement   per card.  They  suggest a number  of                                   fields on  each card, such as the requirements rationale,  the dependencies on other                                   requirements, the source of the requirements, supporting  materials, and so on. This                                   is similar  to the  approach used in the example of  a structured specification   shown                                   in Figure  4.10.                                       To use a structured approach to specifying system requirements, you define one or                                   more standard templates for requirements and represent these templates as structured                                   forms. The specification may be structured around the objects manipulated by the sys-                                   tem, the functions performed by the system, or the events processed by the system.

A    description  of the side effects (if  any) of the operation.                                       Using  structured  specifications   removes some of  the problems  of  natural lan-                                   guage specification. Variability  in  the specification  is reduced and requirements are                                   organized more effectively.  However, it  is still  sometimes difficult  to  write require-                                   ments in  a clear and unambiguous  way, particularly   when complex  computations                                   (e.g., how to calculate the insulin dose) are to be specified.                                       To  address this  problem,  you  can  add extra  information   to  natural  language                                   requirements, for example, by using tables or graphical models of the system. These                                   can show how computations proceed, how the system state changes, how users inter-                                   act with the system, and how sequences of actions are performed.                                       Tables are particularly  useful when there are a number of possible alternative sit-                                   uations and you need to describe the actions to be taken for each of these. The insulin                                   pump bases its  computations  of the  insulin  requirement  on the  rate of  change of                                   blood sugar levels. The rates of change are computed using the current and previous                                   readings.

These focus on assessing if the system is useful to the business                                   (feasibility   study), discovering  requirements  (elicitation   and analysis), converting                                   these requirements into  some standard form  (specification),  and checking  that the                                   requirements actually define the system that the customer wants (validation).  I have                                   shown these as sequential processes in  Figure 2.6.  However, in  practice,  require-                                   ments engineering is an iterative process in which the activities are interleaved.                                        Figure 4.12 shows this  interleaving.  The activities   are organized as an iterative                                   process around a spiral,  with   the output  being  a system requirements  document.                                   The amount of time  and effort devoted to each activity  in each iteration  depends on                                   the stage of the  overall  process and the type of  system being  developed. Early  in                                   the process, most  effort  will   be  spent on understanding  high-level   business and117100 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering       FPO Feasibility studies     A feasibility study is a short, focused study that should take place early in the RE process. It should answer three     key questions: a) does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization? b) can the system be     implemented within schedule and budget using current technology? and c) can the system be integrated with     other systems that are used?        If the answer to any of these questions is no, you should probably not go ahead with the project.                       http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/FeasibilityStudy.html                                   non-functional  requirements, and the user requirements for the system. Later  in the                                   process, in the outer rings of  the spiral, more effort  will   be devoted to eliciting  and                                   understanding the detailed  system requirements.                                       This  spiral  model accommodates approaches to development where the require-                                   ments are developed to different levels of detail. The number of iterations around the                                   spiral can vary so the spiral  can be exited after some or all of  the user requirements                                   have been elicited. Agile development can be used instead of prototyping so that the                                   requirements and the system implementation are developed together.                                       Some people  consider requirements engineering to be the  process of applying  a                                   structured analysis method,  such as object-oriented  analysis (Larman,  2002). This                                   involves analyzing the system and developing a set of graphical system models, such                                   as use case models, which then serve as a system specification.  The set of  models                                   describes the behavior of  the system and is  annotated with  additional  information                                   describing, for example, the system’s required performance or reliability.                                       Although  structured  methods have a role to play in the requirements engineering                                   process, there is much more  to requirements  engineering than is  covered by these                                   methods. Requirements elicitation,   in  particular, is  a human-centered activity   and                                   people dislike the constraints imposed on it by  rigid system models.                                       In  virtually  all  systems, requirements change. The people involved develop a bet-                                   ter understanding of what they  want the software to do; the organization  buying the                                   system changes; modifications   are made to the  system’s hardware,  software, and                                   organizational environment.  The process of managing these changing requirements                                   is called requirements management, which I cover in Section 4.7.                       4.5 Requirements                      elicitation              and      analysis                                   After  an initial   feasibility    study, the  next stage of  the  requirements  engineering                                   process is requirements elicitation  and analysis. In  this activity,  software engineers                                   work with  customers and system end-users to find out about the application domain,                                   what services the  system should provide,  the required  performance of  the system,                                   hardware constraints, and so on.118                                                                                    4.5 \\x02 Requirements    elicitation  and  analysis 101                                                                                         1.

RequirementsFigure 4.13 The                                                                Prioritization andrequirements elicitation                                                        Negotiationand analysis process                                        Requirements elicitation and analysis may  involve a variety  of different  kinds of                                   people in  an organization. A  system stakeholder is  anyone who should  have some                                   direct or  indirect  influence  on the system requirements. Stakeholders include  end-                                   users who will  interact with  the system and anyone else in an organization who will                                   be affected by it. Other  system stakeholders might be engineers who are developing                                   or maintaining  other related systems, business managers, domain experts, and trade                                   union representatives.                                        A process model of  the elicitation  and analysis process is shown in Figure  4.13.                                   Each organization  will  have its  own version  or instantiation  of  this general  model                                   depending on local factors such as the expertise of the staff, the type of system being                                   developed, the standards used, etc.                                        The process activities are:                                   1. Requirements   discovery This is the process of interacting with stakeholders of the                                          system to discover their requirements. Domain requirements from stakeholders and                                          documentation are also discovered during this activity. There are several comple-                                          mentary techniques that can be used for requirements discovery, which I discuss                                          later in this section.                                   2. Requirements    classification   and organization This   activity   takes the unstruc-                                          tured collection   of  requirements, groups  related requirements,  and organizes                                          them into coherent clusters. The most common way of grouping requirements is                                          to use a model of the system architecture to identify  sub-systems and to associ-                                          ate requirements with  each sub-system. In  practice, requirements  engineering                                          and architectural design cannot be completely separate activities.                                   3. Requirements    prioritization    and negotiation Inevitably,    when multiple   stake-                                          holders are involved, requirements will  conflict.  This  activity  is concerned with                                          prioritizing    requirements  and  finding   and resolving   requirements  conflicts                                          through negotiation.  Usually,  stakeholders have to meet to  resolve differences                                          and agree on compromise requirements.119102 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering                                   4. Requirements   specification The  requirements are documented and input into the                                          next round  of the  spiral. Formal  or  informal  requirements documents  may be                                          produced, as discussed in Section 4.3.                                        Figure  4.13 shows  that  requirements   elicitation   and  analysis  is  an iterative                                   process with continual  feedback from  each activity  to other  activities.  The process                                   cycle starts with requirements discovery and ends with the requirements documenta-                                   tion. The  analyst’s understanding of the requirements  improves with  each round of                                   the cycle. The cycle ends when the requirements document is complete.                                        Eliciting  and understanding requirements from  system stakeholders is a difficult                                   process for several reasons:                                   1. Stakeholders    often don’t  know what  they want from  a computer system except                                          in the most general terms; they may find  it difficult   to articulate what they want                                          the system to do; they may make unrealistic  demands because they don’t know                                          what is and isn’t  feasible.                                   2. Stakeholders    in a system naturally express requirements in their own  terms and                                          with  implicit   knowledge  of their  own work.  Requirements  engineers, without                                          experience in the customer’s domain, may not understand these requirements.                                   3. Different     stakeholders have different  requirements and they may express these                                          in different  ways. Requirements engineers have to discover all potential sources                                          of requirements and discover commonalities and conflict.                                   4. Political      factors may  influence  the requirements  of a  system. Managers may                                          demand specific system requirements because these will allow them to increase                                          their influence  in the organization.                                   5. The    economic  and business environment  in which  the  analysis takes place is                                          dynamic.  It inevitably  changes during  the analysis process. The importance of                                          particular  requirements may change. New requirements may emerge from  new                                          stakeholders who were not originally  consulted.                                        Inevitably, different  stakeholders have different views on the importance and pri-                                   ority  of  requirements   and,  sometimes,  these views  are  conflicting.   During   the                                   process, you should organize regular stakeholder negotiations  so that compromises                                   can be reached. It is impossible to  completely satisfy  every stakeholder but if  some                                   stakeholders feel that their  views have not been properly  considered then they may                                   deliberately attempt to undermine the RE process.                                        At the requirements specification  stage, the requirements that have been elicited                                   so far are documented in such a way that they can be used to help with requirements                                   discovery. At this  stage, an early version of the system requirements document may                                   be produced with  missing sections and incomplete  requirements. Alternatively,  the                                   requirements may be documented in  a completely  different  way (e.g.,  in a spread-                                   sheet or on cards). Writing  requirements on cards can be very effective as these are                                   easy for stakeholders to handle, change, and organize.120                                                                               4.5 \\x02 Requirements    elicitation  and  analysis 103  FPO ViewpointsA viewpoint is way of collecting and organizing a set of requirements from a group of stakeholders who havesomething in common. Each viewpoint therefore includes a set of system requirements. Viewpoints might comefrom end-users, managers, etc. They help identify the people who can provide information about theirrequirements and structure the requirements for analysis.                     http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/Viewpoints.html                4.5.1 Requirements            discovery                              Requirements discovery (sometime called requirements elicitation)  is the process of                              gathering information  about the required system and existing systems, and distilling                              the user and system requirements from this information. Sources of information dur-                              ing the requirements  discovery phase include documentation,  system stakeholders,                              and specifications of  similar  systems. You interact with  stakeholders through inter-                              views and observation and you may use scenarios and prototypes to help stakehold-                              ers understand what the system will be like.                                  Stakeholders range from end-users of a system through managers to external stake-                              holders such as regulators, who certify the acceptability of  the system. For example,                              system stakeholders for the mental healthcare patient information system include:                              1. Patients   whose information  is recorded in  the system.                              2. Doctors    who are responsible for assessing and treating patients.                              3. Nurses    who  coordinate  the  consultations  with  doctors  and administer   some                                     treatments.                              4. Medical     receptionists who manage patients’ appointments.                              5. IT    staff  who are responsible for installing  and maintaining the system.                              6. A    medical  ethics manager who must ensure that the system meets current ethi-                                     cal guidelines for  patient care.                              7. Healthcare    managers who obtain management information from  the system.                              8. Medical     records staff who are responsible for ensuring that  system information                                     can be maintained and preserved, and that record keeping procedures have been                                     properly implemented.                                  In  addition  to system stakeholders, we have already seen that requirements may                              also come from the application domain and from  other systems that interact with the                              system being  specified. All   of  these must be considered  during  the requirements                              elicitation  process.                                  These different  requirements sources (stakeholders, domain, systems) can all be                              represented as system  viewpoints   with  each viewpoint   showing  a  subset of  the121104 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering                                   requirements for the system. Different   viewpoints on  a problem see the problem in                                   different ways. However, their  perspectives are not completely independent but usu-                                   ally overlap  so that they have common requirements. You can use these viewpoints                                   to structure both the discovery and the documentation of the system requirements.                    4.5.2 Interviewing                                   Formal or  informal  interviews   with  system stakeholders are part  of most  require-                                   ments engineering processes. In these interviews, the requirements engineering team                                   puts questions to stakeholders about the system that they currently  use and the sys-                                   tem to be developed. Requirements are derived from the answers to these questions.                                   Interviews may be of two  types:                                   1. Closed    interviews, where the stakeholder answers a pre-defined set of questions.                                   2. Open    interviews,   in which  there  is no pre-defined  agenda. The  requirements                                          engineering team explores a range of issues with system stakeholders and hence                                          develop a better understanding of their needs.                                       In  practice, interviews  with stakeholders are normally a mixture  of both of  these.                                   You may have to obtain the answer to certain questions but these usually lead on to                                   other issues that are discussed in a less structured way. Completely open-ended dis-                                   cussions rarely work well.  You usually have to ask some questions to get started and                                   to keep the interview focused on the system to be developed.                                       Interviews  are good for getting an overall understanding of  what stakeholders do,                                   how they might  interact with the new system, and the difficulties  that they face with                                   current systems. People  like  talking  about their  work  so are usually  happy  to get                                   involved in  interviews.  However, interviews are not so helpful  in  understanding the                                   requirements from the application  domain.                                       It  can be difficult  to elicit  domain knowledge through interviews  for two  reasons:                                   1. All      application  specialists  use terminology   and jargon  that  are specific  to  a                                          domain. It is  impossible for them to discuss domain requirements without  using                                          this terminology.   They normally  use terminology   in a  precise and subtle way                                          that is easy for requirements engineers to misunderstand.                                   2. Some    domain knowledge  is so  familiar  to stakeholders that  they either find  it                                          difficult  to explain  or they think  it is so fundamental that it isn’t  worth mention-                                          ing. For example, for  a librarian,  it goes without  saying that all acquisitions  are                                          catalogued before they are added to the library. However, this may not  be obvi-                                          ous to the interviewer, and so it isn’t  taken into account in the requirements.                                       Interviews  are also not an effective technique for eliciting  knowledge about orga-                                   nizational requirements and constraints because there are subtle power relationships                                   between the different people in the organization. Published organizational structures122                                                               4.5 \\x02 Requirements    elicitation  and  analysis 105              rarely match the reality  of decision making  in an organization but interviewees may              not wish to reveal the actual rather than the theoretical structure to a stranger. In gen-              eral, most  people  are generally  reluctant  to  discuss political    and organizational              issues that may affect the requirements.                  Effective  interviewers have two characteristics:              1. They    are open-minded, avoid  pre-conceived ideas about the requirements, and                     are willing  to listen to stakeholders. If  the stakeholder comes up with surprising                     requirements, then they are willing  to change their mind about the system.              2. They    prompt the interviewee to get discussions going using a springboard question,                     a requirements proposal, or by working together on a prototype system. Saying to                     people ‘tell me what you want’ is unlikely to result in useful information. They find                     it much easier to talk in a defined context rather than in general terms.                  Information  from  interviews supplements other information about the system from              documentation describing business processes or existing systems, user observations,              etc. Sometimes, apart from the information   in the system documents, the interview              information  may be the only  source of information   about the system requirements.              However, interviewing   on its  own is  liable to  miss essential information   and so it              should be used in conjunction with other requirements elicitation techniques.4.5.3 Scenarios              People usually   find  it  easier to  relate  to real-life   examples  rather  than  abstract              descriptions. They can understand and criticize a scenario of how they might interact              with  a software  system. Requirements  engineers can  use the information   gained              from this discussion to formulate  the actual system requirements.                  Scenarios can be particularly  useful  for adding  detail to an outline  requirements              description.  They are descriptions  of  example interaction  sessions. Each scenario              usually covers  one or a small  number  of possible  interactions.  Different  forms  of              scenarios are developed and they provide different types of  information  at different              levels of  detail  about the system.  The stories used  in extreme  programming,  dis-              cussed in Chapter 3, are a type of requirements scenario.                  A  scenario starts with an outline of the interaction. During  the elicitation  process,              details are added to this  to create a complete description  of  that interaction.  At  its              most general, a scenario may include:              1. A    description  of what the system and users expects when the scenario starts.              2. A    description  of the normal flow  of events in the scenario.              3. A    description  of what can go wrong and how this is  handled.              4. Information     about other activities that might  be going on at the same time.              5. A    description  of the system state when the scenario finishes.123106 Chapter        4 \\x02 Requirements        engineering     INITIAL ASSUMPTION:     The patient has seen a medical receptionist who has created a record in the system and collected the patient’s     personal information (name, address, age, etc.). A nurse is logged on to the system and is collecting medical history.     NORMAL:     The nurse searches for the patient by family name. If there is more than  one patient with  the same surname,     the given name (first  name in English) and date of birth  are used to identify the  patient.     The nurse chooses the menu option to  add medical history.     The nurse then follows a series of prompts from  the system to enter information  about  consultations elsewhere     on mental  health problems (free text  input), existing medical conditions  (nurse selects conditions from menu),     medication currently  taken (selected from menu),  allergies (free text), and home life  (form).     WHAT CAN GO WRONG:     The patient’s record does not exist or cannot be found.  The nurse should create a new record and record     personal information.     Patient conditions or medication  are not entered  in the menu. The nurse should choose the ‘other’  option and     enter free text describing the condition/medication.     Patient cannot/will  not  provide information  on medical history. The nurse should enter free text recording the     patient’s inability/unwillingness   to provide information.  The system should print the standard exclusion form     stating that the lack of information may mean   that treatment will  be limited  or delayed. This should be signed     and handed to  the patient.     OTHER ACTIVITIES:     Record may be consulted but not  edited by other staff while  information  is being entered.     SYSTEM STATE ON COMPLETION:     User is logged on. The patient record including medical history is entered  in the database, a record is added to     the system log showing the  start and end time of  the session and the nurse involved.                                            Scenario-based    elicitation    involves   working    with   stakeholders   to  identify   scenar-Figure 4.14 Scenariofor collecting medical ios      and  to capture   details  to  be included   in  these scenarios.   Scenarios  may  be  writtenhistory in MHC-PMS as      text,  supplemented    by diagrams,   screen  shots,  etc. Alternatively,     a more  structured                                       approach   such as  event scenarios   or  use cases may  be  used.                                            As   an  example   of  a simple   text   scenario,   consider   how   the  MHC-PMS     may  be                                       used  to  enter   data  for   a new  patient    (Figure   4.14).   When   a  new  patient    attends  a                                       clinic,    a new   record  is  created   by  a medical    receptionist    and  personal   information                                       (name,  age,  etc.)  is added  to  it. A  nurse  then  interviews    the patient   and collects   med-                                       ical   history.   The  patient   then  has an  initial   consultation     with   a doctor   who  makes  a                                       diagnosis    and,   if  appropriate,      recommends    a  course   of  treatment.     The  scenario                                       shows  what  happens  when   medical   history   is collected.                       4.5.4 Use           cases                                       Use  cases  are  a requirements    discovery    technique   that  were   first   introduced   in   the                                       Objectory    method    (Jacobson   et al.,   1993).

This  is then                                   supplemented by additional  information  describing the interaction  with  the system.                                   The additional  information   may be a textual  description  or one or  more graphical                                   models such as UML sequence or state charts.                                        Use cases are documented using a high-level  use case diagram. The  set of use                                   cases represents all of the possible interactions that will   be described in the system                                   requirements. Actors in the process, who may be human or other systems, are repre-                                   sented as stick figures. Each class of  interaction  is represented as a named ellipse.                                   Lines link  the  actors with  the interaction. Optionally,   arrowheads may be added to                                   lines to show how the interaction is initiated.  This is illustrated in Figure  4.15, which                                   shows some of the use cases for the patient information system.                                        There is no hard and fast distinction between scenarios and use cases. Some peo-                                   ple consider that each use case is a single scenario; others, as suggested by Stevens                                   and Pooley (2006), encapsulate a set of scenarios in a single use case. Each scenario                                   is a single thread through the use case. Therefore, there would be a scenario for the                                   normal interaction  plus scenarios for each possible exception.  You can, in practice,                                   use them in either way.                                        Use cases identify the individual  interactions between the system and its users or                                   other systems. Each use case should be documented with a textual description. These                                   can then be linked to other models in the UML that will  develop the scenario in more                                   detail.  For example,  a brief  description   of the  Setup Consultation  use case from                                   Figure 4.15 might be:                                        Setup consultation allows two or  more doctors, working  in different offices, to                                        view the same record at the same time. One doctor initiates the consultation by                                        choosing the people involved from a drop-down  menu of doctors who  are on-                                        line. The patient record is then displayed on their screens but only the initiating                                        doctor can edit  the record. In  addition,  a text chat window  is created to  help125108 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering                                        coordinate actions. It is assumed that a phone conference for voice communica-                                        tion will  be separately set up.                                        Scenarios and use cases are effective techniques for eliciting  requirements from                                   stakeholders who interact directly  with  the system. Each type  of interaction  can be                                   represented as a use case. However, because they focus on interactions with the sys-                                   tem, they are not as effective for eliciting  constraints or high-level business and non-                                   functional  requirements or for discovering domain  requirements.                                        The UML  is  a de facto standard for  object-oriented  modeling, so use cases and                                   use case–based elicitation are now widely used for requirements elicitation. I discuss                                   use cases further in Chapter 5 and show  how they are used alongside other system                                   models to document a system design.                     4.5.5 Ethnography                                   Software systems do not exist  in isolation.  They  are used in a social and organiza-                                   tional context  and software system requirements may  be derived or constrained by                                   that context. Satisfying  these social and organizational requirements is often critical                                   for the success of the system. One reason why many software systems are delivered                                   but never used is that their requirements do not take proper account of how the social                                   and organizational context affects the practical operation of  the system.                                        Ethnography is an observational technique that can be used to understand opera-                                   tional processes and help derive support requirements  for these processes. An ana-                                   lyst immerses himself  or herself in  the working  environment where the system will                                   be used. The day-to-day   work  is observed  and notes made of  the actual  tasks in                                   which  participants are involved.  The value of  ethnography is  that it  helps discover                                   implicit   system requirements that  reflect  the actual ways  that people work,  rather                                   than the formal processes defined by the organization.                                        People often find  it very  difficult   to articulate details  of their  work  because it is                                   second nature to them. They understand their own work  but may  not understand its                                   relationship to other  work in  the organization. Social and organizational factors that                                   affect the  work,  but which  are not obvious  to individuals,   may only  become clear                                   when noticed by an unbiased observer. For example, a work group may self-organize                                   so that members know of each other’s work and can cover for each other if someone                                   is absent. This may not be mentioned during an interview as the group might not see                                   it as an integral part of their work.                                        Suchman (1987)  pioneered  the use of  ethnography  to study  office  work.   She                                   found  that  the actual  work   practices  were far  richer,   more complex,   and more                                   dynamic than the simple models assumed by office automation  systems. The differ-                                   ence between the assumed and the actual work was the most important reason why                                   these office  systems  had no  significant   effect  on  productivity.   Crabtree  (2003)                                   discusses a wide range of  studies since  then and describes, in  general, the  use of                                   ethnography in systems design. In my own  research, I have investigated methods of126                                                                                    4.5 \\x02 Requirements    elicitation  and  analysis 109                                             Ethnographic             Debriefing                  Focused                                                Analysis                   Meetings               EthnographyFigure 4.16                                                                                                                            PrototypeEthnography and                                                                                                                  Evaluationprototyping for                                                  Generic System                Systemrequirements                                                     Development                Prototypinganalysis                                   integrating  ethnography  into  the software  engineering  process by  linking  it  with                                   requirements  engineering   methods  (Viller    and Sommerville,    1999;  Viller   and                                   Sommerville,  2000) and documenting patterns of interaction in  cooperative systems                                   (Martin  et al., 2001; Martin  et al., 2002; Martin  and Sommerville, 2004).                                        Ethnography is particularly  effective for  discovering two types of requirements:                                   1. Requirements     that are derived  from  the way  in  which  people actually   work,                                          rather than  the way in  which  process definitions  say they  ought to  work.  For                                          example,  air  traffic   controllers   may  switch  off  a conflict    alert  system that                                          detects  aircraft  with   intersecting   flight   paths,  even though  normal  control                                          procedures specify  that  it  should  be used. They  deliberately  put  the aircraft                                          on conflicting   paths for  a short  time to  help manage the airspace. Their  con-                                          trol  strategy is  designed to ensure that these aircrafts  are moved  apart before                                          problems occur  and they find  that the conflict   alert alarm  distracts them from                                          their  work.                                   2. Requirements    that are derived from cooperation and awareness of other people’s                                          activities.  For  example, air  traffic  controllers  may  use an awareness of other                                          controllers’  work  to  predict the  number of  aircrafts that  will  be entering  their                                          control  sector. They then modify their  control  strategies depending on that pre-                                          dicted workload.  Therefore, an automated ATC system should allow controllers                                          in a sector to have some visibility  of the work  in adjacent sectors.                                        Ethnography can be combined with  prototyping  (Figure  4.16). The ethnography                                   informs the development of  the prototype so that fewer prototype  refinement cycles                                   are required. Furthermore,  the prototyping  focuses the ethnography  by identifying                                   problems and questions that can then be discussed with the ethnographer. He or she                                   should then look for  the answers to these questions during the next phase of the sys-                                   tem study (Sommerville  et al., 1993).                                        Ethnographic studies can reveal critical   process details that are often missed by                                   other requirements   elicitation   techniques.  However,  because of its  focus  on the                                   end-user, this approach is not always appropriate  for  discovering organizational  or                                   domain  requirements.  They  cannot always  identify   new  features that  should  be                                   added to a system. Ethnography  is  not, therefore,  a complete  approach to elicita-                                   tion on its  own and it should  be used to complement other approaches, such as use                                   case analysis.127110 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering                   Requirements reviews     A requirements review is a process where a group of people from the system customer and the system     developer read the requirements document in detail and check for errors, anomalies, and inconsistencies. Once     these have been detected and recorded, it is then up to the customer and the developer to negotiate how the     identified problems should be solved.                            http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/Reviews.html                      4.6 Requirements                       validation                                   Requirements validation is the process of checking that requirements actually define                                   the system that the customer really wants. It overlaps with analysis as it is concerned                                   with  finding  problems with  the requirements. Requirements validation  is important                                   because errors in a requirements document can lead to extensive rework costs when                                   these problems are discovered during development or after the system is in service.                                       The  cost of fixing  a requirements problem by making  a system change is usually                                   much greater than  repairing  design or  coding  errors. The reason for  this  is that  a                                   change to the requirements usually  means that the system design and implementa-                                   tion must also be changed. Furthermore the system must then be re-tested.                                       During   the requirements validation  process, different types  of checks should be                                   carried out on the requirements in the requirements document. These checks include:                                   1. Validity    checks A user may think that a system is needed to perform certain func-                                          tions. However, further thought and analysis may identify  additional or  different                                          functions  that are  required. Systems have diverse  stakeholders with  different                                          needs and any set of requirements is inevitably  a compromise across the stake-                                          holder community.                                   2. Consistency    checks Requirements in the document should not conflict.  That  is,                                          there should  not be  contradictory  constraints  or  different  descriptions  of  the                                          same system function.                                   3. Completeness   checks The requirements document should include  requirements                                          that define all functions  and the constraints intended by the system user.                                   4. Realism     checks Using  knowledge   of  existing  technology,   the requirements                                          should be checked to ensure that they can actually be implemented. These checks                                          should also take account of the budget and schedule for the system development.                                   5. Verifiability To      reduce the potential for  dispute between customer and contrac-                                          tor, system requirements  should always  be written  so that  they are verifiable.                                          This means that you  should be able to write  a set of tests that can demonstrate                                          that the delivered system meets each specified requirement.128                                                                                                    4.7 \\x02 Requirements    management 111                                                                    Initial                                        Changed                                                              Understanding                           Understanding                                                                of Problem                                  of Problem                                                                    Initial                                                ChangedFigure 4.17                                            Requirements                                    RequirementsRequirementsevolution                                                                                                                           Time                                        There are  a number  of  requirements   validation   techniques that  can  be used                                   individually  or in  conjunction with  one another:                                   1. Requirements    reviews The requirements are analyzed systematically by  a team                                          of reviewers who check for  errors and inconsistencies.                                   2. Prototyping In     this approach to validation, an executable model of the system in                                          question is demonstrated to end-users and customers. They can experiment with                                          this model to see if it  meets their real needs.                                   3. Test-case    generation Requirements    should  be  testable.  If  the  tests for   the                                          requirements  are devised as part  of the  validation  process, this  often  reveals                                          requirements problems. If  a test is difficult  or impossible to  design, this usually                                          means that the requirements will be difficult  to  implement and should be recon-                                          sidered. Developing tests from the user requirements before any code is written                                          is an integral part of extreme programming.                                        You should not underestimate the problems involved  in requirements  validation.                                   Ultimately,  it is difficult   to show that a set of requirements does in fact meet a user’s                                   needs. Users need to picture the system in  operation and imagine  how that  system                                   would  fit into  their  work.  It is  hard even for skilled  computer professionals  to per-                                   form this  type of abstract analysis and harder still for  system users. As a result, you                                   rarely find  all requirements problems  during the requirements validation  process. It                                   is inevitable that there will  be further requirements changes to correct omissions and                                   misunderstandings after the requirements document has been agreed upon.                       4.7 Requirements                      management                                   The requirements for large software systems are always changing. One reason for this is                                   that these systems are usually developed to address ‘wicked’ problems—problems that                                   cannot be completely defined. Because the problem cannot be fully defined, the soft-                                   ware requirements are bound to be incomplete. During the software process, the stake-                                   holders’ understanding of the problem is constantly changing (Figure 4.17). The system                                   requirements must then also evolve to reflect this changed problem view.129112 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering                   Enduring and volatile requirements     Some requirements are more susceptible to change than others. Enduring requirements are the requirements that     are associated with the core, slow-to-change activities of an organization. Enduring requirements are associated     with fundamental work activities. Volatile requirements are more likely to change. They are usually associated with     supporting activities that reflect how the organization does its work rather than the work itself.                         http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/EnduringReq.html                                       Once a system has been installed and is regularly used, new requirements inevitably                                   emerge. It is hard for  users and system customers to anticipate what effects the new                                   system will have on their business processes and the way that work is done. Once end-                                   users have experience of a system, they will discover new needs and priorities. There                                   are several reasons why change is inevitable:                                   1. The    business and  technical  environment  of  the system always  changes after                                          installation.  New hardware may be introduced, it  may be necessary to interface                                          the system with other systems, business priorities may change (with consequent                                          changes in the  system support required),  and new  legislation  and regulations                                          may be introduced that the system must necessarily abide by.                                   2. The    people  who pay  for  a system and the users of  that system  are rarely  the                                          same people. System customers impose requirements because of organizational                                          and budgetary constraints. These may conflict  with  end-user requirements and,                                          after delivery, new features may have to be added for user support if the system                                          is to meet its goals.                                   3. Large    systems usually have a diverse user community, with  many users having                                          different  requirements and  priorities  that may  be conflicting   or contradictory.                                          The final  system requirements are inevitably  a compromise between them and,                                          with experience, it is often discovered that the balance of support given to differ-                                          ent users has to be changed.                                       Requirements   management  is  the process  of  understanding   and controlling                                   changes to system requirements. You need to keep track of individual  requirements                                   and maintain   links  between  dependent requirements  so  that you  can  assess the                                   impact of  requirements changes. You need to establish a formal process for making                                   change proposals and linking  these to system requirements. The formal  process of                                   requirements management should start as soon as a draft version of the requirements                                   document is available. However, you should start planning how to  manage changing                                   requirements during the requirements elicitation  process.                     4.7.1 Requirements            management      planning                                   Planning is  an essential first  stage in  the requirements  management process. The                                   planning  stage establishes  the  level  of  requirements  management  detail  that  is                                   required. During  the requirements management stage, you have to decide on:130                                                                                                    4.7 \\x02 Requirements    management 113                  Identified                                                                                                                     Revised                   Problem     Problem Analysis and         Change Analysis               Change         Requirements                                      Change Specification            and Costing              Implementation                                   1. Requirements    identification Each   requirement  must be uniquely   identified  soFigure 4.18Requirements change       that it can be cross-referenced with  other requirements and used in traceabilitymanagement                     assessments.                                   2. A    change management process This is the set of activities that assess the impact                                          and cost of changes. I discuss this process in more detail in the following section.                                   3. Traceability    policies These policies define the relationships between each require-                                          ment and between the requirements and the system design that should be recorded.                                          The traceability policy should also define how these records should be maintained.                                   4. Tool    support Requirements management involves the processing of large amounts                                          of information about the requirements. Tools that may be used range from specialist                                          requirements management systems to spreadsheets and simple database systems.                                       Requirements  management needs automated support and the software tools  for                                   this should be chosen during the planning phase. You need tool support for:                                   1. Requirements   storage The requirements should be maintained in a secure, man-                                          aged data store that is accessible to everyone involved in the requirements engi-                                          neering process.                                   2. Change    management The process of change management (Figure 4.18) is sim-                                          plified  if active tool  support is available.                                   3. Traceability      management As   discussed above, tool   support  for  traceability                                          allows  related requirements to  be discovered. Some tools  are available which                                          use natural language processing techniques to  help discover possible  relation-                                          ships between requirements.                                       For  small systems, it may not be necessary to use specialized requirements man-                                   agement tools. The requirements management process may be supported using the                                   facilities  available  in  word processors, spreadsheets, and PC databases. However,                                   for larger  systems, more specialized tool  support is required.  I have included  links                                   to information  about requirements management tools in  the book’s web pages.                     4.7.2 Requirements            change    management                                   Requirements change management (Figure 4.18) should be applied  to all  proposed                                   changes to a system’s requirements after the requirements document has been approved.                                   Change management is essential because you need to decide if the benefits of imple-                                   menting new requirements are justified by the costs of implementation. The advantage of131114 Chapter    4 \\x02 Requirements     engineering       FPO Requirements   traceability     You need to keep track of the relationships between requirements, their sources, and the system design so      that you can analyze the reasons for proposed changes and the impact that these changes are likely to have on     other parts of the system. You need to be able to trace how a change ripples its way through the system. Why?                       http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Requirements/ReqTraceability.html                                   using a formal process for change management is that all change proposals are treated                                   consistently and changes to the requirements document are made in a controlled way.                                       There are three principal  stages to a change management process:                                   1. Problem    analysis and change specification The process starts with an identified                                          requirements problem  or, sometimes, with  a specific  change proposal. During                                          this  stage, the problem  or the change proposal  is analyzed  to check  that it  is                                          valid. This  analysis is fed back to the change requestor who may respond with a                                          more specific requirements change proposal, or decide to withdraw  the request.                                   2. Change    analysis  and  costing The  effect  of  the proposed  change is  assessed                                          using traceability   information   and general  knowledge  of the  system require-                                          ments. The cost of  making  the change is estimated both in  terms of  modifica-                                          tions to the requirements document and, if appropriate, to the system design and                                          implementation.  Once this analysis is completed, a decision is made whether or                                          not to proceed with the requirements change.                                   3. Change    implementation The  requirements document and, where necessary, the                                          system  design and  implementation,   are modified.   You  should  organize  the                                          requirements document  so that you  can make changes to it  without  extensive                                          rewriting  or  reorganization.  As with  programs,  changeability  in documents  is                                          achieved by minimizing   external references and making the document sections                                          as modular as possible. Thus, individual  sections can be changed and replaced                                          without  affecting other parts of the document.                                       If  a new requirement has to be urgently implemented, there is always a temptation to                                   change the system and then retrospectively modify the requirements document. You                                   should try to avoid this as it almost inevitably leads to the requirements specification and                                   the system implementation getting out of step. Once system changes have been made, it                                   is easy to forget to include these changes in the requirements document or to add infor-                                   mation to the requirements document that is inconsistent with the implementation.                                       Agile  development processes, such as extreme programming, have been designed                                   to cope with   requirements  that change during  the  development process.  In these                                   processes, when a user proposes a requirements  change, this  change does not go                                   through a formal  change management process. Rather, the user has to prioritize that                                   change and, if it is high priority, decide what system features that were planned for the                                   next iteration should be dropped.132                                                                                                              Chapter 4 \\x02 Further   reading 115 KEY      POINTS       \\x02 Requirements   for a software system set out what the system should do and define constraints             on its operation and implementation.       \\x02 Functional   requirements are statements of the services that the system must provide  or are             descriptions of how some computations must  be carried out.       \\x02 Non-functional    requirements often constrain the system being developed and the development             process being used.

Requirements management is the process of managing and controlling             these changes.FURTHER      READING       Software Requirements, 2nd edition.

Identify  and briefly describe four types of requirement  that may be defined for a computer-                based system.         4.2. Discover ambiguities or omissions in the  following statement of requirements  for part of a                ticket-issuing  system:                An automated ticket-issuing  system sells rail tickets. Users select their destination  and                input  a credit card and a personal identification number. The rail ticket is issued and their                credit card account charged. When the user presses the start button, a menu display of                potential  destinations  is activated, along with a message to the user to select a destination.                Once a destination has been selected, users are requested to input their credit card. Its                validity  is checked and the user is then requested to input a personal identifier. When the                credit transaction  has been validated, the ticket is issued.         4.3. Rewrite the above description using the structured  approach described in this chapter.                Resolve the identified ambiguities  in an appropriate way.         4.4. Write a set of non-functional  requirements for the ticket-issuing  system, setting out its                expected reliability  and response time.         4.5. Using the technique suggested here, where natural language descriptions  are presented in                a standard format, write  plausible user requirements for the following  functions:                \\x02 An  unattended petrol  (gas) pump system that includes a credit card reader.

The fuel is delivered and the customer’s account debited.                \\x02 The  cash-dispensing function in a bank ATM.                \\x02 The  spelling-check and correcting function  in a word processor.         4.6. Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification                might  keep track of the relationships between functional  and non-functional requirements.         4.7. Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve                as a basis for understanding the requirements  for an ATM system.         4.8. Who should be involved in a requirements review? Draw a process model showing how a                requirements  review might be organized.         4.9. When emergency changes have to be made to systems, the system software may have to be                modified  before changes to the requirements have been approved. Suggest a model of a                process for making these modifications  that will  ensure that the requirements document                and the system implementation  do not become inconsistent.       4.10. You have taken a job with a software user who has contracted your previous employer to                develop a system for them. You discover that your company’s interpretation of the                requirements  is different from the interpretation  taken by your previous employer. Discuss                what you should  do in such a situation. You know that the costs to your current employer                will  increase if the ambiguities are not resolved. However, you have also a responsibility of                confidentiality  to your previous  employer.134                                                                                                                     Chapter 4 \\x02 References 117REFERENCES       Beck, K.

When you have read the chapter, you will:            \\x02 understand how graphical models can be used to represent                software systems;            \\x02 understand why different types of model are required and the                fundamental system modeling perspectives of context, interaction,                structure, and behavior;            \\x02 have been introduced to some of the diagram types in the Unified                Modeling Language (UML) and how these diagrams may be used in                system modeling;            \\x02 be aware of the ideas underlying model-driven engineering, where a                system is automatically generated from structural and behavioral                models.

System modelinghas generally come to mean representing the  system using some kind  of graphicalnotation, which  is now  almost always  based on notations in  the Unified  ModelingLanguage (UML).   However,  it  is also possible  to develop  formal  (mathematical)models of  a system, usually  as a detailed  system specification.   I cover  graphicalmodeling using the UML  in  this chapter and formal modeling in  Chapter 12.    Models  are used during the requirements engineering  process to help derive therequirements for a system, during the design process to describe the system to engi-neers implementing the system and after implementation  to  document the system’sstructure and operation. You may develop models of both the existing system and thesystem to be developed:1. Models    of  the existing system are used during requirements engineering.  They       help clarify   what the existing  system does and can be used as a basis for  dis-       cussing its strengths and weaknesses. These then lead to requirements  for the       new system.2. Models     of the  new system are used during  requirements  engineering  to help       explain the proposed requirements to other system stakeholders. Engineers use       these models to discuss design proposals and to document the system for imple-       mentation. In  a model-driven  engineering  process, it is  possible to generate a       complete or partial system implementation  from the system model.    The most important  aspect of a system model is that it leaves out detail. A modelis an abstraction of the system being studied rather than an alternative representationof that system. Ideally, a representation of a system should maintain all the informa-tion about  the entity  being represented. An  abstraction deliberately  simplifies  andpicks out the most salient characteristics. For example, in  the very unlikely  event ofthis book being serialized in a newspaper, the presentation there would be an abstrac-tion of  the book’s  key  points.  If  it were  translated from  English  into  Italian,   thiswould be an alternative representation. The translator’s intention  would  be to main-tain all the information  as it is presented in English.    You may develop different  models to represent the system from different perspec-tives. For example:1. An    external perspective, where you model the context or environment of the system.2. An    interaction  perspective where you model  the interactions between a system       and its environment or between the components of a system.3. A    structural  perspective, where you  model the organization  of a system or  the       structure of the data that is processed by the system.4. A    behavioral perspective, where you model the dynamic behavior  of the system       and how it responds to events.137120 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                                       These perspectives have much in common with  Krutchen’s 4  + 1 view of  system                                   architecture (Kruchten,  1995), where  he suggests that you should document a  sys-                                   tem’s architecture and organization  from different  perspectives. I discuss this 4  + 1                                   approach in Chapter 6.                                       In  this chapter, I  use diagrams defined in  UML  (Booch  et al., 2005;  Rumbaugh                                   et al., 2004),  which  has become a standard modeling language for  object-oriented                                   modeling. The  UML  has many diagram types and so supports the creation of many                                   different  types of  system model.  However,  a survey  in 2007  (Erickson  and Siau,                                   2007) showed  that most users of  the UML   thought  that five  diagram  types could                                   represent the essentials of a system:                                   1. Activity      diagrams, which  show  the activities  involved  in  a process or in  data                                          processing.                                   2. Use    case diagrams, which show the interactions between a system and its envi-                                          ronment.                                   3. Sequence   diagrams, which show interactions between actors and the system and                                          between system components.                                   4. Class    diagrams, which  show the  object classes in the system  and the associa-                                          tions between these classes.                                   5. State   diagrams, which show how the system reacts to internal and external events.                                       As  I do not  have space to discuss all of the UML  diagram types here, I  focus on                                   how these five key types of diagram are used in system modeling.                                       When  developing  system models, you  can often be flexible   in the way  that the                                   graphical notation is used. You do not always need to stick rigidly   to the details of a                                   notation. The detail and rigor  of a model depends on how you intend to use it. There                                   are three ways in which graphical models are commonly  used:                                   1. As    a means of facilitating  discussion about an existing or proposed system.                                   2. As    a way of documenting  an existing system.                                   3. As     a  detailed   system  description   that  can  be  used to  generate  a  system                                          implementation.                                       In   the  first   case, the  purpose  of  the  model   is  to  stimulate   the  discussion                                   amongst the  software  engineers involved   in developing  the  system. The  models                                   may be  incomplete  (so long  as they  cover the  key points  of  the  discussion)  and                                   they may use the modeling  notation  informally.   This  is how  models are normally                                   used in so-called  ‘agile  modeling’  (Ambler   and Jeffries, 2002).  When models  are                                   used as documentation, they  do not have to  be complete as you may  only  wish to                                   develop  models for  some  parts of  a system.  However,  these models  have to  be                                   correct—they  should  use the notation  correctly  and be an accurate description  of                                   the system.138                                                                                                                   5.1 \\x02 Context    models 121              The Unified Modeling LanguageThe Unified Modeling Language is a set of 13 different diagram types that may be used to model softwaresystems. It emerged from work in the 1990s on object-oriented modeling where similar object-orientednotations were integrated to create the UML. A major revision (UML 2) was finalized in 2004. The UML isuniversally accepted as the standard approach for developing models of software systems. Variants have beenproposed for more general system modeling.                                        http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/UML/                                   In the third  case, where models are used as part of  a model-based development                              process, the system models have to be both complete and correct. The reason for this                              is  that  they  are used  as a basis  for  generating  the  source  code of   the system.                              Therefore, you have to be very careful  not to confuse similar  symbols, such as stick                              and block arrowheads, that have different meanings.                   5.1 Context               models                              At  an early stage in the specification  of a system, you  should decide on the system                              boundaries. This  involves working   with  system stakeholders to decide  what func-                              tionality  should be included in the system and what is provided by the system’s envi-                              ronment.  You  may  decide that  automated  support  for  some  business processes                              should be implemented but  others should be manual processes or supported by dif-                              ferent systems. You should  look  at possible overlaps in  functionality   with  existing                              systems and decide where  new functionality   should  be implemented.  These deci-                              sions should  be made early  in  the process to  limit  the  system costs and the  time                              needed for understanding the system requirements and design.                                   In some cases, the boundary between a system and its environment  is relatively                              clear. For example, where  an automated system is replacing  an existing manual  or                              computerized system, the environment of  the new system is usually the same as the                              existing  system’s  environment.  In  other cases, there  is more  flexibility,    and you                              decide what constitutes the boundary between the system and its environment during                              the requirements engineering process.                                   For example, say you are developing the specification for  the patient information                              system for mental healthcare. This  system is intended to manage information  about                              patients attending mental health clinics and the treatments that have been prescribed.                              In developing  the specification for  this system, you have to decide whether the sys-                              tem should  focus exclusively  on collecting  information   about consultations  (using                              other systems to  collect personal  information  about  patients) or whether  it  should                              also collect personal patient information.  The advantage of relying  on other systems                              for  patient information  is  that you avoid  duplicating  data. The major disadvantage,                              however, is that  using other  systems may make it  slower to  access information.  If                              these systems are unavailable, then the MHC-PMS cannot be used.139122 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                                                                                                «system»                                                                                           Patient Record                                                                                                 System                                                           «system»                                                                                                                                    «system»                                                        Management                                                                                                                                    Admissions                                                          Reporting                                                                                                                                      System                                                            System                                                                                                «system»                                                                                               MHC-PMS                                                           «system»                                                          «system»                                                        HC Statistics                                                      Prescription                                                            System                                                              System                                                                                                «system»Figure 5.1 The context                                                        Appointments                                                                                                 Systemof the MHC-PMS                                       The  definition   of  a system boundary  is not  a value-free  judgment.  Social  and                                   organizational  concerns may mean that the position  of  a system boundary may  be                                   determined by non-technical factors. For example, a system boundary may be delib-                                   erately positioned  so that the analysis process can all  be carried out on  one site; it                                   may be chosen so that a particularly difficult  manager need not be consulted; it may                                   be positioned so that the system cost is increased and the system development divi-                                   sion must therefore expand to design and implement the system.                                       Once some decisions on the boundaries of the system have been made, part of the                                   analysis activity  is the definition  of that  context and the dependencies that a system                                   has on its environment. Normally, producing  a simple architectural model is the first                                   step in this activity.                                       Figure  5.1 is  a simple context  model that  shows the patient information  system                                   and the other  systems in  its  environment.  From  Figure  5.1, you  can see that the                                   MHC-PMS   is connected  to  an appointments  system and  a more general  patient                                   record system with which it  shares data. The system is also connected to systems for                                   management reporting and hospital  bed allocation  and a statistics system that  col-                                   lects information  for research. Finally, it  makes use of a prescription system to gen-                                   erate prescriptions for patients’ medication.                                       Context  models normally  show that the environment includes several other auto-                                   mated systems. However, they do  not show the  types of relationships  between the                                   systems in the environment and the system that is being specified. External systems                                   might produce data for or consume data from the system. They might share data with                                   the system, or they might be connected directly, through a network or not  connected                                   at all.  They might  be physically  co-located or  located in  separate buildings. All  of                                   these relations may affect the requirements and design of  the system being defined                                   and must be taken into account.                                       Therefore,   simple  context  models are  used along  with  other  models, such  as                                   business process models. These describe human and automated processes in which                                   particular software systems are used.140                                                                                                                        5.1 \\x02 Context    models 123        Confirm       Detention                                         [Not Available]     Transfer to        Decision                                                                    Police Station                                                      Find Secure                                                          Place        [Available]                                       Inform                                                                                            Transfer to                  Social Care                               Inform                                                     Secure                             Patient of                                                               [Dangerous]           Hospital                               Rights                                                                                      Inform Next                                                                                                                                   of Kin                               Record                            Detention                                                 Admit to                        Update                             Decision                           [Not                 Hospital                       Register                                                                 Dangerous]                             «system»                                                «system»                     «system»                            MHC-PMS                                              Admissions                  MHC-PMS                                                                                              System                                        Figure 5.2 is a model of an important  system process that shows the processes inFigure 5.2 Processmodel of involuntary which   the  MHC-PMS  is used. Sometimes, patients who  are suffering  from  mentaldetention                    health problems  may be  a danger to others  or to  themselves. They may  therefore                                   have to be detained against their will  in a hospital so that treatment can be adminis-                                   tered. Such detention is subject to strict legal safeguards—for example, the decision                                   to detain a patient must be regularly reviewed so that people are not held indefinitely                                   without  good reason. One of the functions  of the MHC-PMS   is to ensure that such                                   safeguards are implemented.                                        Figure 5.2 is a UML  activity  diagram. Activity  diagrams are intended to show the                                   activities that make up a system process and the flow of control  from one activity  to                                   another. The start of a process is indicated by a filled circle; the end by a filled  circle                                   inside another circle. Rectangles with round corners represent activities, that is, the spe-                                   cific sub-processes that must be carried out. You may include objects in activity charts.                                   In Figure 5.2,  I have shown the systems that are used to support different processes.                                   I have indicated that these are separate systems using the UML stereotype feature.                                        In a UML activity  diagram, arrows represent the flow of work from  one activity to                                   another. A solid  bar is  used to indicate  activity  coordination.  When the  flow  from                                   more than one activity  leads to a solid  bar then all of  these activities must be com-                                   plete before progress is possible. When the flow  from  a solid bar leads to a number                                   of activities, these may be executed in parallel. Therefore, in Figure 5.2, the activities                                   to inform  social care and the patient’s next of kin,  and to update the detention regis-                                   ter may be concurrent.                                        Arrows may be annotated with  guards that indicate the condition  when that flow                                   is taken. In  Figure 5.2, you  can see guards showing the flows  for  patients who are141124 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                                   dangerous and not dangerous to society. Patients who are dangerous to society must                                   be detained in  a secure facility.   However,  patients  who are suicidal   and so are a                                   danger to themselves may be detained in an appropriate ward in a hospital.                       5.2 Interaction                    models                                   All  systems involve  interaction  of  some kind.  This can be user  interaction,  which                                   involves user inputs  and outputs,  interaction  between the system being  developed                                   and other systems or interaction  between the components of  the system. Modeling                                   user interaction is important  as it helps to identify  user requirements. Modeling sys-                                   tem to  system interaction  highlights  the communication   problems that  may arise.                                   Modeling  component interaction helps us understand if a proposed system structure                                   is likely  to deliver the required system performance and dependability.                                       In  this section, I cover two  related approaches to interaction modeling:                                   1. Use    case modeling,   which  is  mostly   used to model  interactions   between  a                                          system and external actors (users or other systems).                                   2. Sequence    diagrams,  which   are used to  model  interactions   between system                                          components, although external agents may also be included.                                       Use case models and sequence diagrams present interaction at different levels of                                   detail and so may be used together. The details of the interactions involved in a high-                                   level use case may be documented in a sequence diagram. The UML  also includes                                   communication  diagrams  that  can be used to  model interactions.   I don’t  discuss                                   these here as they are an alternative representation of sequence charts. In fact, some                                   tools can generate a communication diagram from a sequence diagram.                     5.2.1 Use       case   modeling                                   Use case modeling was originally  developed by Jacobson et al. (1993) in the 1990s                                   and was incorporated into the first  release of the UML  (Rumbaugh et al., 1999). As                                   I have discussed in Chapter 4, use case modeling is widely  used to support require-                                   ments elicitation. A  use case can be taken as a simple scenario that describes what a                                   user expects from a system.                                       Each use case represents a discrete task that involves external interaction  with  a                                   system. In  its  simplest  form,   a use case  is shown  as an  ellipse  with  the  actors                                   involved  in the  use case represented as stick figures. Figure  5.3 shows a  use case                                   from the MHC-PMS   that represents the task of uploading data from the MHC-PMS                                   to a more general patient record  system. This more general system maintains  sum-                                   mary data  about a patient  rather  than the data  about each consultation,   which  is                                   recorded in the MHC-PMS.142                                                                                                                   5.2 \\x02 Interaction     models 125                                                                                            Transfer DataFigure 5.3 Transfer-data use case                             Medical Receptionist                                    Patient Record System                                        Notice that there are two actors in  this use case: the operator who is transferring                                   the data and  the patient  record  system. The  stick  figure  notation  was  originally                                   developed to cover human interaction but it is also now used to represent other exter-                                   nal systems and  hardware. Formally,  use case diagrams should  use lines  without                                   arrows as arrows in the UML  indicate the direction  of flow  of messages. Obviously,                                   in a use case messages pass in both directions. However, the arrows in Figure 5.3 are                                   used informally  to indicate that the medical receptionist  initiates the transaction and                                   data is transferred to the patient record system.                                        Use case diagrams give a fairly simple overview  of an interaction  so you have to                                   provide more detail to understand what is involved. This detail can either be a simple                                   textual description, a structured description  in a table, or a sequence diagram as dis-                                   cussed below. You chose the most appropriate format depending on the use case and                                   the level of  detail  that you think  is  required in the  model. I  find  a standard tabular                                   format to be the most useful. Figure  5.4 shows a tabular description of the ‘Transfer                                   data’ use case.                                        As I  have discussed in Chapter 4, composite use case diagrams show a number                                   of different  use cases. Sometimes, it is possible to  include all  possible interactions                                   with a system in a single composite use case diagram. However, this may be impos-                                   sible because of the  number of  use cases. In such cases, you may develop severalFigure 5.4 Tabular                                   diagrams, each of which shows related use cases. For example, Figure 5.5 shows alldescription of the‘Transfer data’            of  the use cases in the  MHC-PMS   in  which  the actor  ‘Medical   Receptionist’   isuse case                    involved.

The UML  has a rich syntax for  sequence diagrams, which allows many  dif-                                   ferent kinds of interaction  to be modeled. I don’t have space to cover all possibilities                                   here so I focus on the basics of this diagram type.                                       As  the name implies, a sequence diagram shows the sequence of interactions that                                   take place during a particular use case or use case instance. Figure 5.6 is an example                                   of a sequence diagram that illustrates the basics of the notation. This diagram models                                   the interactions involved  in the View  patient information  use case, where a medical                                   receptionist can see some patient information.                                       The objects and actors involved are listed along the top of the diagram, with a dot-                                   ted line  drawn vertically  from  these. Interactions  between objects are indicated by                                   annotated arrows. The rectangle on the dotted lines indicates the lifeline of the object                                   concerned (i.e., the  time that  object instance is  involved  in the  computation).  You                                   read the sequence of interactions from top to bottom. The annotations on the arrows                                   indicate the calls to the objects, their parameters, and the return values. In this exam-                                   ple, I  also show the  notation used to  denote alternatives. A  box named alt  is used                                   with the conditions  indicated in square brackets.                                       You  can read Figure 5.6 as follows:                                   1. The    medical  receptionist triggers  the ViewInfo  method in  an instance P of  the                                          PatientInfo object  class, supplying the patient’s identifier, PID.  P is a user inter-                                          face object, which is  displayed as a form showing patient information.                                   2. The    instance P calls the database to return the information   required, supplying                                          the receptionist’s  identifier  to allow  security checking  (at this stage, we do not                                          care where this UID  comes from).144                                                                                                                   5.2 \\x02 Interaction     models 127                                         Medical Receptionist                                                                             P: PatientInfo       D: MHCPMS-DB    AS: Authorization                                                            ViewInfo (PID)        Report (Info, PID,                                                                                           UID)                                                                                                                          Authorize (Info,                                                                                                                          UID)                                                                                                                             Authorization                                                     Alt                                                    [Authorization OK]              Patient Info                                                    [Authorization Fail]         Error (No Access)Figure 5.6 Sequencediagram for View patient information                                   3. The    database checks with an authorization system that the user is authorized for                                          this action.                                   4. If     authorized, the patient information is returned and a form on the user’s screen                                          is filled  in. If  authorization fails,  then an error message is returned.                                        Figure 5.7 is a second example of a sequence diagram from the same system that                                   illustrates two  additional  features. These are the direct communication between the                                   actors in the system and the creation of objects as part of a sequence of operations. In                                   this example, an object of type Summary is created to hold the summary data that is to                                   be uploaded to the PRS (patient record system). You can read this diagram as follows:                                   1. The    receptionist logs on to the PRS.                                   2. There     are two  options  available.  These allow  the  direct  transfer  of  updated                                          patient information  to the PRS and the transfer of summary health data from the                                          MHC-PMS  to the PRS.                                   3. In    each case, the receptionist’s permissions are checked using the authorization                                          system.                                   4. Personal    information  may be transferred directly  from  the user interface object                                          to the PRS. Alternatively,  a summary record  may be created from the database                                          and that record is then transferred.                                   5. On    completion   of the  transfer, the  PRS issues a status message and the user                                          logs off.145128 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling   Medical Receptionist                                                                                                                           PRS                                        P: PatientInfo       D: MHCPMS-DB    AS: Authorization                                                                                                                               Login ( )                                  OK                Alt               [SendInfo]                       UpdateInfo( )                                                    Update PRS (UID )                                                                                   Authorize (TF, UID)                                                                                      Authorization                                                                                                                            Update (PID)                                                                                                                             Update OK                                                         Message (OK)               [SendSummary]                    UpdateSummary( )                                                     Summarize (UID )                                                                                   Authorize (TF, UID)                                                                                        Authorization                                                                                                                              :Summary                                                                                                                                        Update (PID)                                                                                                                                            Update OK                                                        Message (OK)                                                                                                                   Logout ( )                                        Unless  you are using  sequence diagrams for  code generation or  detailed docu-Figure 5.7 Sequencediagram for transfer mentation,    you  don’t  have to  include  every interaction   in these diagrams.  If  youdata                            develop system models  early in  the development  process to support requirements                                   engineering and high-level design, there will  be many interactions which  depend on                                   implementation decisions. For example, in  Figure 5.7 the decision on how to get the                                   user’s identifier to check authorization  is one that can be delayed. In an implementa-                                   tion, this might  involve interacting  with a User object but this is not important  at this                                   stage and so need not be included in the sequence diagram.146                                                                                                                5.3 \\x02 Structural    models 129              Object-oriented requirements analysisIn object-oriented requirements analysis, you model real-world entities using object classes.

These each presentunique information about the system that is being specified.                                        http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/OORA/                  5.3 Structural                   models                              Structural  models of  software display  the organization  of a system in  terms of  the                              components that make up that system and their relationships. Structural models may                              be static models, which show the structure of  the system design or dynamic models,                              which  show the organization  of the system when  it is  executing. These are not the                              same things—the dynamic  organization  of  a system as a set of interacting  threads                              may be very different  from a static model of  the system components.                                   You create structural models of a system when you are discussing and designing                              the system architecture.

I cover different  aspects of software                              architecture and architectural  modeling in  Chapters 6, 18, and 19. In  this section, I                              focus on  the use of  class diagrams for  modeling  the static  structure  of the  object                              classes in a software system.                5.3.1 Class        diagrams                              Class diagrams are used when developing an object-oriented system model to show                              the classes in a system and the associations between these classes. Loosely, an object                              class can be thought of as a general definition of one kind of system object. An asso-                              ciation  is a link  between classes that indicates  that there is a  relationship between                              these classes. Consequently, each class may  have to have some  knowledge of  its                              associated class.                                   When you  are developing models  during  the early stages of  the software  engi-                              neering process, objects represent something in  the real world,  such as a patient, a                              prescription,  a doctor, etc. As an implementation  is developed, you  usually need to                              define additional  implementation  objects that  are used to provide the required  sys-                              tem functionality.  Here, I  focus on the modeling  of real-world  objects as part of the                              requirements or early software design processes.                                   Class diagrams in the UML can be expressed at different levels of detail. When you                              are developing a  model, the first  stage is usually  to look  at the world,  identify   the                              essential objects, and represent these as classes. The simplest way of writing these is to                              write the class name in a box. You can also simply note the existence of an association147130 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                                                                                            1               1 PatientFigure 5.8 UML                                                     Patient                                                                                                                   Recordclasses and association                                   by drawing a line between classes. For example, Figure 5.8 is a simple class diagram                                   showing two classes: Patient and Patient Record with an association between them.                                        In Figure 5.8, I  illustrate  a further feature of class diagrams—the ability  to  show                                   how many objects  are involved in  the association. In this  example, each end of the                                   association is annotated with  a 1, meaning  that there is a 1:1  relationship  between                                   objects of these classes. That is, each patient has exactly one record and each record                                   maintains information   about exactly one  patient. As  you can see from  later exam-                                   ples, other multiplicities  are possible. You can define that an exact number of objects                                   are involved or, by using a *, as shown in Figure 5.9, that there are an indefinite num-                                   ber of objects involved in  the association.                                        Figure 5.9 develops this type of class diagram to show that objects of class Patient                                   are also involved in  relationships with  a number of other  classes. In this example, I                                   show that you can name associations to give the reader an indication  of  the type of                                   relationship that exists. The UML   also allows the role of the objects participating  in                                   the association to be specified.                                        At this  level of  detail, class diagrams look  like  semantic data models. Semantic                                   data models are used in database design. They show the data entities, their associated                                   attributes, and the relations  between these entities. This approach to modeling  was                                   first  proposed in the mid-1970s  by Chen  (1976); several variants have been devel-                                   oped since then (Codd, 1979; Hammer and McLeod, 1981; Hull and King,  1987), all                                   with the same basic form.                                        The UML   does not include  a specific  notation for  this  database modeling as it                                   assumes an object-oriented development process and models data using objects and                                   their  relationships.  However,  you can  use the UML   to represent  a semantic data                                   model. You can think of entities in a semantic data model as simplified object classes                                                                                              Consultant                                                                                                  1                                                                                                       Referred-to                                                                                               1..*                                                                       1..*           1..*                  1..*             1 General                                                      Condition                           Patient                                                                         Diagnosed-                      Referred-by Practitioner                                                                              with           1..*                                                                                                       Attends                                                                                               1..*                                                                                                                   Prescribes                                                                                            Consultation                      Medication                                                                                                                1..*         1..*                                                                                               1..*                                                                                                       Runs Prescribes                                                                                               1..4                                  TreatmentFigure 5.9 Classes                                                                                                 1..*                                                                                                Hospitaland associations in the                                                                                                 DoctorMHC-PMS148                                                                                                                     5.3 \\x02 Structural    models 131                                                                                             Consultation                                                                                    Doctors                                                                                    Date                                                                                    Time                                                                                    Clinic                                                                                    Reason                                                                                    Medication Prescribed                                                                                    Treatment Prescribed                                                                                    Voice Notes                                                                                    Transcript                                                                                    ...

When  showing  the  associations between classes, it  is  convenient  to represent                                   these classes in the simplest possible way.  To define them in  more detail,  you add                                   information  about  their attributes  (the characteristics  of  an object) and  operations                                   (the things that you  can request from an object).  For example, a Patient object  will                                   have the attribute Address and you may include an operation called ChangeAddress,                                   which is  called when a patient  indicates that they have moved from  one address to                                   another. In the  UML,  you  show attributes  and operations by extending  the simple                                   rectangle that represents a class. This is illustrated in Figure 5.10 where:                                   1. The    name of the object class is in the top section.                                   2. The    class attributes  are in  the middle  section. This  must include  the attribute                                          names and, optionally, their types.                                   3. The    operations (called methods in  Java and other OO programming languages)                                          associated with the object class are in the lower section of the rectangle.                                       Figure  5.10 shows possible attributes and operations on the class Consultation. In                                   this example, I  assume that doctors record voice  notes that are transcribed later  to                                   record details of the consultation. To prescribe medication, the doctor involved  must                                   use the Prescribe method to generate an electronic prescription.                     5.3.2 Generalization                                   Generalization is an everyday technique that we use to manage complexity.

This allows us to infer that different members of these classes have some                                   common characteristics (e.g., squirrels and rats are rodents). We can make general state-                                   ments that apply to all class members (e.g., all rodents have teeth for gnawing).                                        In modeling  systems, it is often  useful to examine the classes in a system to see                                   if  there is scope for  generalization.  This  means that common  information   will  be                                   maintained  in  one  place only.  This  is  good  design  practice  as it  means that,  if                                   changes are proposed, then you do not  have to look  at all  classes in the system to                                   see if they  are affected by  the change. In object-oriented  languages, such as Java,                                   generalization is implemented  using the class inheritance mechanisms built into the                                   language.                                        The UML   has a specific  type of  association to  denote generalization,  as illus-                                   trated in  Figure 5.11.  The generalization  is shown as an arrowhead pointing  up  to                                   the more general  class. This shows that  general practitioners  and hospital  doctors                                   can be generalized as doctors  and that there are three  types of  Hospital  Doctor—                                   those that  have just  graduated  from   medical  school  and have  to be  supervised                                   (Trainee Doctor);  those that  can work  unsupervised as part of  a consultant’s team                                   (Registered Doctor);   and consultants,  who  are senior  doctors with  full   decision-                                   making responsibilities.                                        In a generalization,   the attributes  and operations  associated with   higher-level                                   classes are also associated with the lower-level  classes. In essence, the lower-level                                   classes are subclasses inherit the attributes and operations from  their  superclasses.                                   These lower-level   classes then add  more specific   attributes  and operations.  For                                   example, all doctors have a name and phone number; all hospital doctors have a staff                                   number and a department but general practitioners don’t have these attributes as they                                   work  independently. They  do however, have a  practice name and address. This  is                                   illustrated  in  Figure 5.12,  which  shows part of  the generalization  hierarchy  that I                                   have extended with class attributes. The operations associated with the class Doctor                                   are intended to register and de-register that doctor with the MHC-PMS.150                                                                                                                   5.4 \\x02 Behavioral    models 133                                                                                                 Doctor                                                                                           Name                                                                                           Phone #                                                                                           E-mail                                                                                           Register ( )                                                                                           De-Register ( )                                                                   Hospital Doctor                   General PractitionerFigure 5.12                                                                 Staff #                                   PracticeA generalization                                                                 Pager #                                 Addresshierarchy with added detail                     5.3.3 Aggregation                                   Objects in the real world are often composed of different  parts. For example, a study                                   pack for a course may be composed of a book, PowerPoint slides, quizzes, and rec-                                   ommendations for further  reading. Sometimes in a system model, you need to illus-                                   trate this.  The UML   provides a special type  of  association between classes called                                   aggregation that means that one object (the whole) is composed of other objects (the                                   parts). To show  this, we  use a diamond shape next to  the class that represents the                                   whole. This is shown in Figure  5.13, which shows that a patient record is a composi-                                   tion of Patient and an indefinite  number of Consultations.                       5.4 Behavioral                   models                                   Behavioral models are models of the dynamic behavior of the system as it is executing.                                   They show what happens or what is supposed to happen when a system responds to a                                   stimulus from its environment. You can think of these stimuli as being of two types:                                   1. Data Some     data arrives that has to be processed by the system.                                   2. Events Some    event happens that triggers system processing. Events  may have                                          associated data but this is not always the case.

DFDs are used to show how data flows through a sequence of processing     steps. For example, a processing step could be the filtering of duplicate records in a customer database. The data     is transformed at each step before moving on to the next stage. These processing steps or transformations     represent software processes or functions where data-flow diagrams are used to document a software design.                                               http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/DFDs                                        Many business systems are data processing systems that are primarily driven by                                   data. They are controlled by the data input to the system with relatively little  external                                   event processing. Their processing involves a sequence of actions on that data and the                                   generation of an output. For example, a phone billing system will  accept information                                   about calls made by a customer, calculate the costs of these calls, and generate a bill                                   to be sent to that customer. By contrast, real-time systems are often event driven with                                   minimal data processing. For example, a landline phone switching system responds to                                   events such as ‘receiver off hook’ by generating a dial tone, or the pressing of keys on                                   a handset by capturing the phone number, etc.                     5.4.1 Data-driven           modeling                                   Data-driven models show the sequence of actions involved  in processing input  data                                   and generating an associated output. They are particularly useful during the analysis                                   of requirements as they can be used to show end-to-end processing in a system. That                                   is, they  show the  entire  sequence of actions  that take  place from  an  input  being                                   processed to the corresponding output, which is the system’s response.                                        Data-driven  models were  amongst  the first  graphical  software  models.  In  the                                   1970s, structured methods such as DeMarco’s Structured Analysis (DeMarco, 1978)                                   introduced data-flow  diagrams (DFDs)  as a way of illustrating   the processing steps                                   in a system. Data-flow models are useful because tracking and documenting how the                                   data associated with a particular  process moves through  the system helps analysts                                   and designers understand what is going on. Data-flow diagrams are simple and intu-                                   itive and it is usually possible to explain them to potential  system users who can then                                   participate in validating  the model.                                        The UML does not support data-flow diagrams as they were originally proposed and                                   used for modeling data processing. The reason for this is that DFDs focus on system                                   functions and do not recognize system objects. However, because data-driven systems                                   are so common in business, UML 2.0 introduced activity diagrams, which are similar to                                   data-flow diagrams. For example, Figure 5.14 shows the chain of processing involved in                                   the insulin pump  software. In this  diagram, you can see the processing steps (repre-                                   sented as activities) and the data flowing between these steps (represented as objects).                                        An alternative way of showing the sequence of processing in a system is to use UML                                   sequence diagrams. You have seen how these can be used to model interaction but, if152                                                                                                                   5.4 \\x02 Behavioral    models 135                                       Purchase Officer                                                                                            Supplier                                                                                                                               «datastore»                                                                  :Order                      Budget                     Orders                                                       Fillin ( )                                                                                Validate ( )                                                                            [Validation OK]                                                                          Update (Amount)Figure 5.14 An activity                                                                            Save ( )                                                                                                                                                Send ( ) model of the insulinpump’s operation                                   you draw these so that messages are only sent from left to right,  then they show the                                   sequential data processing in the system. Figure 5.15 illustrates this, using a sequence                                   model of the processing of an order and sending it to a supplier. Sequence models high-                                   light  objects in a  system, whereas data-flow diagrams highlight   the functions.  The                                   equivalent data-flow diagram for order processing is shown on the book’s web pages.                    5.4.2 Event-driven            modeling                                   Event-driven modeling shows how a system responds to external and internal events. It is                                   based on the assumption that a system has a finite number of states and that events (stim-                                   uli) may cause a transition from one state to another. For example, a system controlling a                                   valve may move from a state ‘Valve open’ to a state ‘Valve closed’ when an operator                                   command (the stimulus) is received. This view of a system is particularly appropriate for                                   real-time systems. Event-based modeling was introduced in real-time design methods                                   such as those proposed by Ward and Mellor (1985) and Harel (1987, 1988).Figure 5.15 Order           The UML  supports event-based modeling using state diagrams, which were based onprocessing                 Statecharts (Harel, 1987, 1988). State diagrams show system states and events that cause              Blood Sugar           Get Sensor                Sensor                  Compute              Blood Sugar                 Sensor                     Value                      Data                  Sugar Level                Level                                                                                                                                           Calculate                                                                                                                                             Insulin                                                                                                                                            Delivery                                                                                                            Calculate                  Insulin                   Control               Pump Control                                             Insulin                                                                                                              Pump                  Pump                     Pump                  Commands                                          Requirement                                                                                                          Commands153136 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                          Full                 Full Power                        Power                                               Do: Set Power                                                    = 600                                                                     Timer                   Waiting                                                                                                       Number                 Do: Display                      Time                           Full               Set Time                                       Operation                                                       Power       Do: Get Number                                Do: Operate                                                                          Exit: Set Time                                        Oven                                                Half                Half                        Power                                                                                           Door              Power                                                                  Closed                                                Cancel                                                              Timer                                                                                                                       Start                                                                                Door                                                                                Open                                                                                                                                       Door                                                                                                                                                                   Waiting                                                 Half Power                                       Enabled                Open                                               Do: Set Power                                 Do: Display                                       Do: Display                                                     = 300                                               'Ready'                                             Time                                                                                                Door Closed                                                                             Disabled                                                                           Do: DisplayFigure 5.16 State diagram                                       'Waiting'of a microwave oven                                   transitions from one state to another. They do not show the flow of data within the system                                   but may include additional information on the computations carried out in each state.                                       I  use an example of control  software for  a very simple  microwave oven to  illus-                                   trate event-driven modeling. Real microwave ovens are actually much more complex                                   than this  system  but the  simplified   system  is easier  to  understand. This  simple                                   microwave has a switch  to select full  or  half power, a numeric  keypad to input  the                                   cooking time, a start/stop button, and an alphanumeric display.                                       I  have assumed that the sequence of actions in using the microwave is:                                   1. Select    the power level (either half  power or full  power).                                   2. Input    the cooking  time using a numeric keypad.                                   3. Press   Start and the food is cooked for the given time.                                       For  safety reasons, the oven should  not operate when  the door is  open and, on                                   completion  of cooking,  a buzzer is  sounded. The oven has a very simple  alphanu-                                   meric display that is used to display various alerts and warning  messages.                                       In  UML   state diagrams, rounded rectangles  represent system states. They may                                   include  a brief  description  (following   ‘do’)  of  the actions  taken in  that state. The                                   labeled arrows represent stimuli that force a transition from one state to another. You                                   can indicate start and end states using filled circles, as in activity diagrams.                                       From   Figure  5.16,  you  can see that  the system  starts  in  a waiting   state and                                   responds initially  to either the full-power  or the half-power button.

Pushing  this   button  starts  the  oven                                       operation   and  cooking   takes  place for   the specified   time.   This  is the  end of  the  cook-                                       ing  cycle   and the  system  returns  to  the  waiting   state.                                            The   UML    notation   lets  you   indicate   the  activity    that  takes  place  in  a  state.  In  a                                       detailed   system  specification    you   have to  provide   more  detail   about  both  the  stimuli                                       and  the system   states.

The   problem    with   state-based    modeling    is  that   the  number    of  possible    states                                       increases  rapidly.

One way to do this is by using the notion  of a superstate that encapsulates a                                   number of  separate states. This superstate looks like  a single state on a high-level                                   model but is then expanded to show more detail on a separate diagram. To illustrate                                   this concept, consider the Operation state in Figure 5.15. This is a superstate that can                                   be expanded, as illustrated in Figure 5.18.                                        The Operation state includes a number of sub-states. It shows that operation starts                                   with a status check and that if any problems are discovered an alarm is indicated and                                   operation is  disabled.  Cooking  involves  running  the microwave  generator for  the                                   specified  time;  on completion,  a buzzer  is sounded. If  the  door is  opened during                                   operation, the system moves to the disabled state, as shown in Figure 5.15.                       5.5 Model-driven                      engineering                                   Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development where mod-                                   els rather than programs are the principal outputs of the development process (Kent,                                   2002; Schmidt, 2006). The programs that execute on a hardware/software platform are                                   then generated automatically from the models. Proponents of MDE argue that this raises                                   the level of abstraction in software engineering so that engineers no longer have to be                                   concerned with programming language details or the specifics of execution platforms.                                        Model-driven engineering has its roots in model-driven architecture (MDA)  which                                   was proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG)  in  2001 as a new software                                   development paradigm. Model-driven engineering and model-driven architecture are                                   often seen as the same thing.  However,  I think  that  MDE  has a wider  scope than156                                                                                  5.5 \\x02 Model-driven    engineering 139             MDA.  As I discuss later in this section, MDA  focuses on the design and implementa-             tion  stages of software development whereas MDE is  concerned with all  aspects of             the software  engineering  process. Therefore, topics  such as model-based require-             ments engineering,  software processes for  model-based development, and  model-             based testing are part of MDE but not, currently, part of MDA.                  Although MDA   has been in use since 2001, model-based engineering is still at an             early stage of development and it is  unclear whether or not it  will  have a significant             effect on software engineering practice. The main arguments for and against MDE are:             1. For    MDE Model-based  engineering allows engineers to think about systems at a                    high  level of  abstraction, without  concern  for the  details of  their implementa-                    tion.  This reduces the likelihood  of errors, speeds up the design and implemen-                    tation  process, and allows  for  the creation  of  reusable, platform-independent                    application  models.  By  using powerful  tools,  system implementations  can be                    generated for different  platforms  from the  same model. Therefore, to adapt the                    system to some new platform technology, it  is only necessary to write a transla-                    tor  for  that platform.  When  this is available,  all  platform-independent  models                    can be rapidly rehosted on the new platform.             2. Against     MDE As  I  discussed earlier in this  chapter, models are a good way of                    facilitating   discussions about  a software design.  However, it  does not always                    follow  that the abstractions that are supported by the model are the right abstrac-                    tions  for implementation.  So, you  may create informal  design models but then                    go  on to implement  the  system using  an off-the-shelf,  configurable   package.                    Furthermore,  the arguments for platform  independence are only valid  for large                    long-lifetime   systems where the platforms  become obsolete during  a system’s                    lifetime.  However, for this  class of systems, we know that implementation is not                    the major problem—requirements  engineering, security and dependability, inte-                    gration with  legacy systems, and testing are more significant.                  There have been significant MDE  success stories reported by the OMG  on their             Web pages (www.omg.org/mda/products_success.htm)    and the  approach is  used             within  large companies such as IBM and Siemens. The techniques have been used suc-             cessfully in the development of large, long-lifetime software systems such as air traffic             management systems. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, model-driven approaches             are not widely  used for software engineering. Like formal  methods of software engi-             neering, which I  discuss in Chapter 12, I believe that MDE  is  an important develop-             ment. However, as is also the  case with formal  methods, it is  not clear whether the             costs and risks of model-driven approaches outweigh the possible benefits.5.5.1 Model-driven           architecture             Model-driven   architecture   (Kleppe,  et  al.,  2003;  Mellor   et al.,  2004;  Stahl  and             Voelter, 2006) is  a model-focused approach to software design and implementation             that uses a sub-set of UML   models to describe a system.

From a high-level platform  independent model it is                                   possible, in principle,  to generate a working program without  manual intervention.                                       The  MDA  method recommends that three types of abstract system model should                                   be produced:                                   1. A     computation  independent  model (CIM)   that models  the important   domain                                          abstractions used in  the system.  CIMs  are sometimes called  domain  models.                                          You may develop  several different CIMs,  reflecting  different  views  of the sys-                                          tem. For example, there may be a security CIM in  which you identify  important                                          security  abstractions such as an asset and a role and a patient  record CIM,  in                                          which you  describe abstractions such as patients, consultations, etc.                                   2. A     platform  independent model (PIM)   that models the operation  of the system                                          without  reference  to its  implementation.  The  PIM  is usually  described  using                                          UML  models that show the static system structure and how it responds to exter-                                          nal and internal events.                                   3. Platform     specific  models  (PSM)  which  are transformations   of  the platform-                                          independent  model  with   a separate PSM  for  each application    platform.   In                                          principle,  there may be layers of  PSM, with  each layer adding  some platform-                                          specific   detail.  So,  the  first-level    PSM  could  be  middleware-specific    but                                          database independent. When a specific  database has been chosen, a database-                                          specific PSM  can then be generated.                                       As  I have said, transformations between these models may be defined and applied                                   automatically  by software tools. This  is illustrated in  Figure 5.19, which  also shows                                   a final level  of automatic transformation.  A transformation  is applied to  the PSM to                                   generate executable code that runs on the designated software platform.                                       At  the time of writing,  automatic CIM to PIM translation is still  at the research pro-                                   totype stage. It is unlikely that completely automated translation tools will be available                                   in the near future. Human intervention, indicated by a stick figure in Figure 5.19, will                                   be needed for the  foreseeable future.

The translation  of PIMs to PSMs is more mature and several commercial tools are                                   available that provide translators from  PIMs  to common platforms  such as Java and                                   J2EE. These rely on  an extensive library  of  platform-specific  rules and patterns to                                   convert the PIM to the PSM. There may be several PSMs for each PIM in the system.                                   If a software system is intended to run on different  platforms (e.g., J2EE and .NET),                                   then it is only  necessary to maintain the PIM. The PSMs for each platform  are auto-                                   matically  generated. This is illustrated in Figure 5.20.                                       Although   MDA-support   tools  include  platform-specific    translators,  it is  often                                   the case that these will  only  offer  partial  support for  the translation  from  PIMs  to                                   PSMs. In  the  vast majority   of  cases, the execution  environment   for  a system is                                   more  than  the  standard   execution   platform   (e.g.,   J2EE,  .NET,   etc.).  It   also                                   includes  other  application    systems, application    libraries   that  are specific   to a                                   company, and user interface  libraries.   As these vary  significantly   from  one com-                                   pany to  another, standard tool  support  is not  available. Therefore,  when  MDA  is                                   introduced,  special purpose translators  may have to  be created that take the char-                                   acteristics  of  the  local  environment   into  account.  In  some cases (e.g.,  for  user                                   interface  generation),   completely    automated  PIM   to PSM  translation   may  be                                   impossible.                                       There  is an uneasy relationship  between agile methods and model-driven  archi-                                   tecture. The notion of extensive up-front modeling contradicts  the fundamental ideas                                   in the agile manifesto  and I suspect that few agile developers feel comfortable  with                                   model-driven engineering.  The developers of MDA  claim  that it  is intended to sup-                                   port an iterative  approach to development and so can be used within agile  methods                                   (Mellor,  et al.,  2004). If  transformations  can be completely  automated and a com-                                   plete program generated from  a PIM,  then, in principle,  MDA   could be used in  an                                   agile development process as no separate coding would be required. However, as far                                   as I am aware, there are no MDA tools that support practices such as regression test-                                   ing and test-driven development.159142 Chapter    5 \\x02 System    modeling                     5.5.2 Executable          UML                                   The fundamental notion behind model-driven engineering is that completely automated                                   transformation of models to code should be possible. To achieve this, you have to be                                   able to construct graphical models whose semantics are well defined. You also need a                                   way of adding information to graphical models about the ways in which the operations                                   defined in the model are implemented. This is possible using a subset of UML 2, called                                   Executable UML   or xUML   (Mellor   and Balcer, 2002).  I don’t  have space here to                                   describe the details of xUML, so I simply present a short overview of its main features.                                        UML  was  designed as  a language for   supporting  and documenting   software                                   design, not as a programming language. The designers of UML  were not concerned                                   with  semantic details of  the language but with  its  expressiveness. They introduced                                   useful notions such as use case diagrams that help with the design but which are too                                   informal  to support execution. To create an executable sub-set of UML,  the number                                   of model types has therefore been dramatically reduced to three key model types:                                   1. Domain    models identify  the principal  concerns in the system. These are defined                                          using UML  class diagrams that include objects, attributes, and associations.                                   2. Class    models,  in  which  classes  are defined,  along  with  their  attributes   and                                          operations.                                   3. State    models, in which a state diagram is associated with each class and is used                                          to describe the lifecycle  of the class.                                        The dynamic  behavior  of  the system may  be specified  declaratively  using  the                                   object  constraint  language (OCL)  or  may  be expressed using UML’s   action  lan-                                   guage. The action language is like  a very  high-level  programming  language where                                   you can refer to objects and their attributes and specify actions to be carried out.  KEY     POINTS       \\x02 A   model is an abstract view of a system that ignores some system details. Complementary system             models can be developed to show the system’s context, interactions, structure, and behavior.       \\x02 Context   models show how a system that is being modeled is positioned in an environment with             other systems and processes. They help define the boundaries of the system to be developed.       \\x02 Use   case diagrams and sequence diagrams are used to describe the interactions between user             the system being designed and users/other  systems. Use cases describe interactions between a             system and external actors; sequence diagrams add more information to these by showing             interactions between system objects.160                                                                                                                        Chapter 5 \\x02 Exercises 143       \\x02 Structural   models  show the organization and architecture of a system. Class diagrams are             used to define the static structure  of classes in a system and their associations.       \\x02 Behavioral   models are used to describe the dynamic behavior of an executing system. This             can be modeled from the perspective of the data processed by the system or by the events             that stimulate  responses from a system.       \\x02 Activity   diagrams may be used to model the processing of data, where each activity             represents one process step.       \\x02 State   diagrams are used to model a system’s behavior in response to internal or external             events.       \\x02 Model-driven    engineering is an approach to software development in which a system is             represented as a set of models that can be automatically transformed to executable code.FURTHER      READING       Requirements Analysis and System Design.

Give                two examples of possible errors that  could arise if software engineers do not understand                the system context.       5.2. How   might you use a model of a system that already exists? Explain why it is not always                necessary for such a system model to be complete and correct. Would the same be true if                you were developing a model of a new system?161144 Chapter     5 \\x02 System   modeling         5.3. You have been asked to develop a system that will help with planning large-scale events                and parties such as weddings, graduation celebrations,  birthday parties,  etc. Using an                activity  diagram, model the process context for such a system that shows the activities                involved in planning  a party (booking a venue, organizing invitations, etc.) and the system                elements that  may be used at each stage.         5.4. For the MHC-PMS, propose a set of use cases that illustrates the interactions between a                doctor, who sees patients and prescribes medicine and treatments, and the MHC-PMS.         5.5. Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers                for a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrollment, so the registration                process must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses                an electronic course catalog to find out  about available courses.         5.6. Look carefully at how messages and mailboxes are represented in the e-mail system that                you use. Model the object classes that might  be used in the system implementation to                represent a mailbox and an e-mail message.         5.7. Based on your experience with a bank ATM, draw an activity diagram that models the data                processing involved when a customer withdraws cash from the machine.         5.8. Draw a sequence diagram for the same system. Explain why you might want to develop                both  activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system.         5.9. Draw state diagrams of the control software  for:                \\x02 An  automatic washing machine that has different  programs for different types of                     clothes.                \\x02 The  software for a DVD player.                \\x02 A  telephone answering system that records incoming messages and displays the                     number of accepted messages on an LED. The system should allow the telephone                     customer to dial in from  any location, type a sequence of numbers (identified as tones),                     and play any recorded messages.       5.10. You are a software engineering manager and your team proposes that model-driven                engineering should  be used to develop a new system. What factors should you take into                account when deciding whether  or not to introduce this new approach to software                development?162                                                                                                                     Chapter 5 \\x02 References 145REFERENCES       Ambler, S.

When you have read the chapter,            you will:            \\x02 understand why the architectural design of software is important;            \\x02 understand the decisions that have to be made about the system                architecture during the architectural design process;            \\x02 have been introduced to the idea of architectural patterns, well-tried                ways of organizing system architectures, which can be reused in                system designs;            \\x02 know the architectural patterns that are often used in different types                of application system, including transaction processing systems and                language processing systems.           Contents           6.1 Architectural design decisions           6.2 Architectural views           6.3 Architectural patterns           6.4 Application architectures165148 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                   Architectural   design  is  concerned  with  understanding  how  a  system should  be                                   organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the model of the soft-                                   ware development process, as shown in  Chapter 2, architectural  design is  the first                                   stage in  the software   design process.  It  is  the critical   link   between  design and                                   requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system                                   and the relationships between them. The output of the architectural design process is                                   an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of commu-                                   nicating components.                                        In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of the development                                   process should  be  concerned  with  establishing   an  overall  system  architecture.                                   Incremental development of  architectures is not usually  successful. While  refactor-                                   ing components in  response to changes is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys-                                   tem architecture is likely  to be expensive.                                        To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider Figure 6.1.                                   This shows  an abstract model  of the  architecture for  a  packing robot  system that                                   shows the components that have to be developed. This robotic system can pack dif-                                   ferent kinds of  object. It uses a vision component to pick  out objects on a conveyor,                                   identify  the type of  object, and select the right  kind  of packaging. The system then                                   moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It places packaged objects                                   on another conveyor. The architectural model shows these components and the links                                   between them.                                        In practice, there is  a significant  overlap between the processes of requirements                                   engineering  and architectural   design.  Ideally,  a system  specification   should  not                                   include  any design information.   This is  unrealistic  except for  very small  systems.                                   Architectural  decomposition is usually  necessary to structure and organize the spec-                                   ification.  Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might pro-                                   pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of system functions                                   or features  with   large-scale  components or  sub-systems.  You  can then  use this                                   decomposition  to discuss the requirements  and features of  the system with  stake-                                   holders.                                        You can design software  architectures at two  levels of  abstraction, which  I  call                                   architecture in the small and architecture  in the large:                                   1. Architecture     in  the small is  concerned with  the architecture of  individual  pro-                                          grams. At this  level, we are concerned with the way  that an individual  program                                          is decomposed into  components.  This chapter  is mostly  concerned with   pro-                                          gram architectures.                                   2. Architecture     in  the large is concerned with  the architecture  of  complex enter-                                          prise  systems  that include   other  systems,  programs,  and program   compo-                                          nents.  These enterprise   systems  are distributed   over  different   computers,                                          which  may be owned  and managed by different   companies.

As Bosch  discusses,                                   individual   components implement   the functional   system requirements.  The non-                                   functional  requirements depend on the system architecture—the way in which these                                   components  are organized  and  communicate.  In  many  systems, non-functional                                   requirements are also influenced  by  individual   components, but there  is no doubt                                   that the architecture of the system is the dominant influence.                                       Bass et al. (2003) discuss three advantages of explicitly designing and document-                                   ing software architecture:                                   1. Stakeholder   communication The architecture is a high-level presentation of the sys-                                          tem that may be used as a focus for discussion by a range of different stakeholders.                                   2. System   analysis Making  the system architecture explicit  at an early stage in the                                          system development  requires  some analysis.  Architectural    design decisions                                          have a profound effect  on whether or  not the system can meet critical  require-                                          ments such as performance, reliability, and maintainability.                                   3. Large-scale    reuse A  model of  a system architecture is a compact,  manageable                                          description of  how a system is organized and how the components interoperate.                                          The system architecture is often the same for systems with similar requirements                                          and so can support large-scale software reuse. As I explain in Chapter 16, it may                                          be possible to develop product-line architectures where the same architecture is                                          reused across a range of related systems.167150 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                        Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can serve firstly as a                                   design plan for the negotiation  of system requirements, and secondly as a means of                                   structuring  discussions with  clients,  developers, and managers. They also  suggest                                   that it is an essential tool for complexity  management. It hides details and allows the                                   designers to focus on the key system abstractions.                                        System architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams, as in Figure 6.1.                                   Each box in the diagram represents a component. Boxes within boxes indicate that the                                   component has been decomposed to sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or con-                                   trol signals are passed from component to component in the direction of the arrows. You                                   can see many examples of this type of architectural model in Booch’s software architec-                                   ture catalog (Booch, 2009).                                        Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system structure, which people                                   from different  disciplines,  who are involved in the system development process, can                                   readily understand. However, in spite of their  widespread use, Bass et al. (2003) dis-                                   like  informal  block  diagrams for  describing an  architecture. They claim  that  these                                   informal  diagrams are poor  architectural  representations, as they show neither  the                                   type of the relationships  among system components nor the components’ externally                                   visible properties.                                        The apparent  contradictions   between  practice  and  architectural   theory  arise                                   because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a program is used:                                   1. As     a way  of  facilitating    discussion   about  the  system design A   high-level                                          architectural  view of  a system is useful for  communication  with  system stake-                                          holders  and project   planning  because it  is  not cluttered   with  detail.  Stake-                                          holders can  relate to  it  and understand an abstract  view  of the  system. They                                          can then discuss the system as a whole  without  being confused by  detail. The                                          architectural   model  identifies  the  key components  that  are to  be developed                                          so managers  can  start  assigning  people  to  plan  the  development  of  these                                          systems.                                   2. As    a way of  documenting an architecture that  has been designed The aim here                                           is to  produce a complete system model that shows the different  components in                                          a system, their  interfaces, and their  connections. The argument for  this  is that                                          such a detailed architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve                                          the system.                                        Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system architecture dur-                                   ing  the design  process,  as they  are a good  way  of  supporting   communications                                   between the people  involved  in the process. In  many projects,  these are often  the                                   only architectural documentation that exists. However, if  the architecture of a system                                   is to be thoroughly  documented then it  is better to use a notation with  well-defined                                   semantics for architectural  description.  However, as I discuss in  Section 6.2, some                                   people think that  detailed documentation is neither useful,  nor really  worth the cost                                   of its development.168                                                                        6.1 \\x02 Architectural     design  decisions 1516.1 Architectural                      design         decisions           Architectural   design is a creative process where  you design a system organization           that will  satisfy the functional  and non-functional requirements of a system. Because           it is a creative process, the activities within  the process depend on the type of system           being  developed, the background  and experience of  the system  architect, and  the           specific  requirements for  the system. It  is therefore useful  to think  of  architectural           design as a series of decisions to be made rather than a sequence of activities.                During  the architectural design process, system architects have to make a number           of  structural   decisions  that  profoundly    affect  the  system  and  its  development           process. Based on their knowledge and experience, they have to consider the follow-           ing fundamental  questions about the system:           1. Is    there a generic application  architecture that can act as a template for the sys-                  tem that is being designed?           2. How     will  the system be distributed across a number of cores or processors?           3. What     architectural patterns or styles might be used?           4. What     will  be the fundamental approach used to structure the system?           5. How     will   the structural   components in  the system  be decomposed into  sub-                  components?           6. What    strategy will be used to control the operation of the components in the system?           7. What    architectural  organization is best for delivering the non-functional  require-                  ments of the system?           8. How     will  the architectural design be evaluated?           9. How     should the architecture of the system be documented?                Although   each software   system  is  unique,  systems in   the same  application           domain often  have similar architectures that reflect  the fundamental concepts of the           domain. For example, application  product lines are applications that are built around           a core architecture with  variants  that satisfy specific  customer requirements. When           designing a system architecture,  you have to decide what  your system and broader           application  classes have in common, and  decide how much  knowledge from  these           application  architectures you can reuse. I discuss generic application architectures in           Section 6.4 and application product  lines in Chapter 16.                For embedded systems  and systems designed for  personal computers,  there is           usually only  a single processor and you will not have to design a distributed architec-           ture  for the  system. However,  most large  systems are now distributed   systems in           which  the  system software   is distributed   across many  different  computers.  The           choice of  distribution  architecture is a key decision that affects the performance and169152 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                   reliability   of the system. This  is a major  topic  in its  own right  and I  cover it  sepa-                                   rately in Chapter 18.                                        The architecture of a software  system may be based on a particular architectural                                   pattern or  style. An  architectural  pattern is  a description  of a system organization                                   (Garlan and Shaw, 1993), such as a client–server organization or a layered architecture.                                   Architectural patterns capture the essence of an architecture that has been used in dif-                                   ferent software systems. You should be aware of common patterns, where they can be                                   used, and their strengths and weaknesses when making decisions about the architec-                                   ture of a system. I discuss a number of frequently used patterns in Section 6.3.                                        Garlan and Shaw’s notion of an architectural style (style and pattern have come to                                   mean the same thing) covers questions 4 to 6 in the previous list. You have to choose                                   the most appropriate structure, such as client–server or layered structuring, that will                                   enable you to meet the system requirements. To decompose structural system units,                                   you decide on the strategy for  decomposing components into sub-components. The                                   approaches that you can use allow different types of architecture to be implemented.                                   Finally,  in the control  modeling  process, you make decisions about how the execu-                                   tion of  components is controlled.  You develop  a general model of  the control rela-                                   tionships between the various parts of the system.                                        Because of the close relationship between non-functional  requirements and soft-                                   ware architecture, the particular architectural  style and structure that you choose for                                   a system should depend on the non-functional system requirements:                                   1. Performance If     performance  is a  critical  requirement,  the architecture  should                                          be designed  to  localize  critical    operations  within   a small  number  of  com-                                          ponents, with these components all deployed on the same computer rather than                                          distributed across the network. This may mean using a few relatively large com-                                          ponents rather than small, fine-grain  components, which reduces the number of                                          component communications.  You may also consider run-time system organiza-                                          tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed on different processors.                                   2. Security If     security is a critical  requirement, a layered structure for the architec-                                          ture should be used, with the most critical  assets protected in the innermost lay-                                          ers, with a high level  of security validation  applied to these layers.                                   3. Safety If    safety is  a critical  requirement, the architecture should be designed so                                          that safety-related operations are all located in either a single component or in a                                          small number of components. This reduces the costs and problems of safety val-                                          idation  and makes  it possible  to  provide  related protection   systems that can                                          safely shut down the system in the event of failure.                                   4. Availability If       availability   is a critical  requirement,  the architecture  should be                                          designed to include  redundant components so that it is  possible to replace and                                          update components without  stopping  the system. I  describe two  fault-tolerant                                          system architectures for high-availability   systems in Chapter 13.                                   5. Maintainability If       maintainability  is a critical  requirement, the system architec-                                          ture should  be designed using fine-grain,  self-contained  components that may170                                                                                            6.2 \\x02 Architectural    views 153                   readily  be changed. Producers of data should be separated from consumers and                   shared data structures should be avoided.                 Obviously  there is  potential  conflict  between  some of  these architectures. For            example, using large components improves performance and using small, fine-grain            components improves maintainability.   If  both performance and maintainability   are            important  system requirements,  then  some compromise  must be found.  This  can            sometimes be achieved by using different architectural patterns or styles for different            parts of the system.                 Evaluating an architectural design is difficult   because the true test of an architec-            ture is  how well  the  system meets its functional   and non-functional  requirements            when it  is in use. However, you  can do some evaluation by comparing  your design            against reference  architectures  or  generic architectural   patterns.  Bosch’s (2000)            description of  the non-functional characteristics of  architectural patterns can also be            used to help with architectural  evaluation.6.2 Architectural                      views            I explained in the introduction  to this  chapter that architectural models of a software            system can be used to focus discussion about the  software requirements or design.            Alternatively,  they may be used to document a design so that it can be used as a basis            for more detailed design and implementation, and for the future evolution  of the sys-            tem. In this section, I  discuss two issues that are relevant to both of these:            1. What    views  or perspectives are useful when designing and documenting  a sys-                   tem’s architecture?            2. What    notations should be used for describing architectural  models?                 It is impossible to represent all relevant information about a system’s architecture in            a single architectural model, as each model only shows one view or perspective of the            system. It might  show how a system is decomposed into modules, how the run-time            processes interact, or the different ways in which  system components are distributed            across a network. All of these are useful at different times so, for both design and doc-            umentation, you usually need to present multiple views of the software architecture.                 There are different  opinions as to  what views  are required. Krutchen  (1995), in            his well-known  4+1 view  model of  software architecture, suggests that there should            be four fundamental architectural views, which  are related using use cases or scenar-            ios. The views that he suggests are:            1. A     logical  view,  which  shows the key abstractions  in the  system as objects or                   object classes. It should be possible to relate the system requirements to entities                   in this logical  view.171154 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                   2. A    process view, which shows how, at run-time, the system is composed of inter-                                          acting   processes. This   view   is  useful  for   making   judgments   about  non-                                          functional  system characteristics such as performance and availability.                                   3. A     development view, which  shows how the software  is decomposed for devel-                                          opment, that is, it shows the breakdown of the software into components that are                                          implemented by a single developer or development team. This view is useful for                                          software managers and programmers.                                   4. A     physical view,  which shows the system hardware and how  software compo-                                          nents are distributed across the processors in the system. This view is useful for                                          systems engineers planning a system deployment.                                        Hofmeister et al. (2000) suggest the use of similar views but add to this the notion                                   of a conceptual view. This view is an abstract view of the system that can be the basis                                   for  decomposing  high-level  requirements  into  more  detailed specifications,   help                                   engineers make  decisions  about  components  that  can be  reused, and  represent                                   a product  line  (discussed in  Chapter 16)  rather than  a single  system. Figure  6.1,                                   which  describes the architecture of a packing  robot, is  an example of a  conceptual                                   system view.                                        In practice,  conceptual  views  are almost  always  developed during  the  design                                   process and are used to support  architectural decision  making.  They are a  way of                                   communicating the essence of a system to different stakeholders. During  the design                                   process, some of the other views  may also be developed when  different  aspects of                                   the system are discussed, but there is no need for a complete description from all per-                                   spectives. It may also be possible to associate architectural patterns, discussed in the                                   next section, with the different  views of a system.                                        There are differing   views  about whether  or not  software architects  should  use                                   the UML   for  architectural  description  (Clements, et  al., 2002).  A  survey in  2006                                   (Lange et al., 2006) showed that, when the UML  was used, it was mostly  applied in                                   a loose and informal way. The authors of that paper argued that this was a bad thing.                                   I disagree  with  this view.  The  UML  was  designed for  describing  object-oriented                                   systems and, at the architectural design stage, you often want to describe systems at                                   a higher level of abstraction. Object classes are too close to the implementation to be                                   useful for architectural  description.                                        I don’t find  the UML to be useful during the design process itself and prefer infor-                                   mal notations  that are quicker to  write  and which  can be easily drawn  on a white-                                   board. The  UML   is of  most value  when you  are documenting   an architecture  in                                   detail or using model-driven  development, as discussed in Chapter 5.                                        A number of  researchers have proposed the use of more specialized architectural                                   description languages (ADLs)   (Bass et al., 2003)  to describe system architectures.                                   The basic elements of ADLs  are components and connectors, and they include rules                                   and guidelines for  well-formed  architectures. However, because of their specialized                                   nature, domain and application specialists find  it  hard to understand and use ADLs.                                   This makes it  difficult  to  assess their usefulness for practical software engineering.                                   ADLs  designed for a particular domain (e.g., automobile  systems) may be used as a172                                                                                                              6.3 \\x02 Architectural     patterns 155    Name                      MVC (Model-View-Controller)    Description              Separates presentation and interaction from the system data. The system is structured into                                    three logical components that interact with each other. The Model component manages                                    the system data and associated operations on that data. The View component defines and                                    manages how the data is presented to the user. The Controller component manages user                                    interaction (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, etc.) and passes these interactions to the View                                    and the Model. See Figure 6.3.    Example                  Figure 6.4 shows the architecture of a web-based application system organized using the                                    MVC pattern.    When used             Used when there are multiple ways to view and interact with data. Also used when the                                    future requirements for interaction and presentation of data are unknown.    Advantages             Allows the data to change independently of its representation and vice versa. Supports                                    presentation of the same data in different ways with changes made in one representation                                    shown in all of them.    Disadvantages        Can involve additional code and code complexity when the data model and interactions                                    are simple.                                   basis for model-driven  development.  However, I  believe that  informal  models andFigure 6.2 The model-view-controller (MVC) notations, such as the UML,   will  remain  the most commonly  used ways  of docu-pattern                       menting  system architectures.                                       Users  of  agile  methods  claim   that detailed   design  documentation  is  mostly                                   unused. It is, therefore, a waste of time and money to develop it. I largely agree with                                   this view  and I  think  that, for  most  systems, it is  not worth  developing  a detailed                                   architectural description from  these four perspectives. You should develop the views                                   that are useful for communication and not worry  about whether or not your architec-                                   tural  documentation  is complete.  However,  an exception  to  this is  when you  are                                   developing critical  systems, when you need to make a detailed dependability analy-                                   sis of  the system. You may  need to convince  external regulators  that your  system                                   conforms to  their regulations  and so complete architectural  documentation may be                                   required.                       6.3 Architectural                      patterns                                   The idea of  patterns as a way of presenting, sharing,  and reusing knowledge about                                   software systems is now  widely  used. The trigger  for this  was the publication  of  a                                   book on object-oriented  design patterns (Gamma et al., 1995), which  prompted  the                                   development of  other  types of  pattern, such as patterns  for organizational   design                                   (Coplien and Harrison, 2004), usability  patterns (Usability  Group, 1998), interaction                                   (Martin    and  Sommerville,    2004),    configuration    management   (Berczuk   and173156 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                                               Controller                                                   View                                                                                                  View                                                     Maps User Actions                                Renders Model                                                                                               Selection                                                     to Model Updates                                  Requests Model Updates                                                     Selects View                                          Sends User Events to                                                                                               User Events Controller                                                                                                          Change                                                                                                    Notification                                                              State                                                                State                                                          Change                                                               Query                                                                                                  Model                                                                                     Encapsulates Application                                                                                     State                                                                                     Notifies View of StateFigure 6.3 The                                                                                     Changesorganization of the MVC                                   Appleton, 2002), and so on. Architectural  patterns were proposed in the 1990s under                                   the name ‘architectural styles’ (Shaw and Garlan, 1996), with a five-volume series of                                   handbooks on pattern-oriented  software  architecture  published between 1996  and                                   2007 (Buschmann et al., 1996;  Buschmann et al., 2007a; Buschmann et al., 2007b;                                   Kircher  and Jain, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2000).                                        In this section,  I introduce  architectural patterns and briefly  describe a selection                                   of architectural  patterns that are commonly  used in  different types  of systems. For                                   more information  about patterns and their use, you should refer to published pattern                                   handbooks.                                        You can think of an architectural pattern as a stylized, abstract description of good                                   practice, which has been tried and tested in different systems and environments. So,                                   an architectural pattern should describe a system organization that has been success-                                   ful in  previous systems. It should include information  of when it  is and is not appro-                                   priate to use that pattern, and the pattern’s strengths and weaknesses.                                        For example, Figure 6.2 describes the well-known Model-View-Controller pattern.                                   This pattern is the basis of interaction management in many web-based systems. The                                   stylized  pattern description includes  the pattern name, a brief  description  (with  an                                   associated graphical model), and an example of the type of system where the pattern                                   is used (again, perhaps with a graphical model). You should also include information                                   about  when  the pattern  should   be used  and its  advantages  and disadvantages.                                   Graphical models of  the architecture associated with the MVC  pattern are shown in                                   Figures 6.3 and 6.4. These present the architecture from different views—Figure 6.3                                   is a conceptual view and Figure 6.4 shows a possible run-time architecture when this                                   pattern is used for interaction management in a web-based system.                                        In a short  section  of  a general  chapter, it  is  impossible  to  describe all  of  the                                   generic patterns that can be  used in software  development. Rather, I present some                                   selected examples of patterns that are widely used and which capture good architec-                                   tural design principles.

The MVC pattern, shown in  Figure 6.2,                                   separates elements of a system, allowing them to  change independently. For exam-                                   ple,  adding a  new view   or changing  an  existing  view  can  be done  without  any                                   changes to the  underlying  data  in the  model. The  layered  architecture  pattern is                                   another way  of  achieving separation  and independence. This  pattern  is shown  in                                   Figure 6.5. Here, the system functionality  is organized into separate layers, and each                                   layer  only  relies  on the facilities   and  services offered  by  the  layer immediately                                   beneath it.                                       This  layered  approach supports the  incremental development  of  systems. As a                                   layer is developed, some of the  services provided by that layer  may be made avail-                                   able to users. The architecture is also changeable and portable. So long as its inter-                                   face is unchanged, a layer can be replaced by another, equivalent layer. Furthermore,                                   when layer interfaces change or new facilities are added to a layer, only the adjacent                                   layer is affected. As layered systems localize machine dependencies in inner layers,                                   this makes it easier to provide multi-platform  implementations of  an application sys-                                   tem. Only   the inner,  machine-dependent  layers  need be re-implemented   to take                                   account of the facilities  of a different operating  system or database.                                       Figure  6.6 is  an example of  a layered architecture  with  four  layers. The lowest                                   layer includes  system support  software—typically   database and operating  system                                   support.  The  next  layer  is  the  application   layer  that  includes   the components                                   concerned with  the application  functionality   and  utility  components  that are used                                   by other  application  components. The third  layer  is concerned with  user interface175158 Chapter        6 \\x02 Architectural        design     Name                        Layered  architecture     Description                Organizes the system into layers with related functionality  associated with each layer.                                        A layer provides services to the layer above it so the lowest-level layers represent core                                       services that are likely to be used throughout  the system. See Figure 6.6.     Example                    A layered model of a system for sharing copyright documents  held in different  libraries, as                                       shown in  Figure 6.7.     When used                Used when building  new facilities on top  of existing systems; when the development is                                       spread across several teams with each team responsibility for a layer of functionality; when                                       there is a requirement for multi-level  security.     Advantages               Allows replacement of  entire layers so long as the interface is maintained. Redundant                                       facilities (e.g., authentication) can be provided  in each layer to increase the dependability                                       of the system.     Disadvantages          In practice, providing a clean separation between  layers is often difficult and a high-level                                       layer may have to interact directly with  lower-level layers rather than through  the layer                                       immediately  below it. Performance can be a problem  because of multiple levels of                                       interpretation  of a service request as it is processed at each layer.                                       management   and  providing    user  authentication    and authorization,     with   the top  layerFigure 6.5 The  layeredarchitecture pattern        providing    user  interface   facilities.    Of   course,  the  number   of  layers  is  arbitrary.   Any                                       of  the  layers  in  Figure  6.6 could    be split  into   two  or  more  layers.                                             Figure  6.7 is  an example  of  how  this layered  architecture   pattern  can  be applied  to a                                       library   system  called  LIBSYS,    which   allows   controlled   electronic   access to  copyright                                       material   from  a group  of university    libraries.  This  has a five-layer   architecture,   with  the                                       bottom   layer  being  the individual    databases in  each library.

My    next   example,    the                                       Repository    pattern   (Figure   6.8),  describes   how  a  set of  interacting    components    can                                       share  data.Figure 6.8 The                     The  majority     of  systems  that   use large   amounts   of  data  are  organized   around   arepository pattern           shared  database  or repository.   This   model  is therefore   suited  to  applications    in which     Name                        Repository     Description                All data in a system is managed in a central repository that  is accessible to all system                                       components. Components do  not interact directly, only through  the repository.     Example                    Figure 6.9 is an example of an IDE where the components use                                        a repository of system design information.  Each software tool generates information which                                       is then available for use by other tools.     When used                You should use this pattern when you  have a system in which large volumes of                                       information  are generated that has to be stored for a long  time. You may also use it in                                       data-driven systems where the inclusion  of data in the repository triggers an action                                        or tool.     Advantages               Components can be independent—they do not  need to know of  the existence of other                                       components. Changes made by one component  can be propagated to all components. All                                       data can be managed consistently (e.g., backups done at the same time)  as it is all in one                                       place.     Disadvantages          The repository is a single point of failure  so problems in the repository  affect the whole                                       system. May be inefficiencies in organizing all communication  through the repository.                                       Distributing the  repository across several computers may be difficult.177160 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                                                                 UML                        Code                                                                                Editors                 Generators                                                                                                                                                   Java                                                                                                                                                  Editor                                                Design                                    Project                                              Translator                               Repository                                                                                                                                                 Python                                                                                                                                                  Editor                                                                                Design                    ReportFigure 6.9 A repository                                          Analyser                 Generatorarchitecture for an IDE                                   data is generated by one component and used by another. Examples of  this type of                                   system include  command and control  systems, management information   systems,                                   CAD  systems, and interactive development environments for software.                                        Figure 6.9 is  an illustration   of a situation  in  which  a repository  might  be used.                                   This diagram  shows an IDE  that  includes  different  tools to  support model-driven                                   development. The repository in  this case might be a version-controlled environment                                   (as discussed in Chapter 25) that keeps track of changes to software and allows roll-                                   back to earlier versions.                                        Organizing tools around a repository is an efficient way  to share large amounts of                                   data. There is no  need to transmit  data explicitly   from  one component to  another.                                   However,  components  must   operate around   an agreed  repository   data  model.                                   Inevitably,  this is a compromise between the specific  needs of each tool and it may                                   be difficult  or impossible to integrate new components if  their data models do not fit                                   the agreed schema. In practice, it may be difficult  to  distribute the repository  over a                                   number of  machines.  Although  it  is  possible to  distribute  a logically   centralized                                   repository, there may be problems with data redundancy and inconsistency.                                        In the example shown  in Figure  6.9, the repository  is passive and control  is the                                   responsibility   of  the components  using  the repository.   An  alternative  approach,                                   which has been derived for AI systems, uses a ‘blackboard’ model that triggers com-                                   ponents when particular data become available. This is appropriate when the form of                                   the repository data is less well structured. Decisions about which tool  to activate can                                   only  be made when the  data has been analyzed. This  model  is introduced  by  Nii                                   (1986). Bosch (2000) includes  a good discussion of how this  style relates to system                                   quality attributes.                     6.3.3 Client–server           architecture                                   The repository pattern is concerned with the static structure of a system and does not                                   show its run-time  organization. My  next  example illustrates a very commonly  used                                   run-time organization  for distributed systems. The Client–server pattern is described                                   in Figure 6.10.178                                                                                                                            6.3 \\x02 Architectural         patterns 161     Name                        Client–server     Description                In a client–server architecture, the functionality  of the system is organized into services,                                       with  each service delivered from a separate server. Clients are users of these services and                                       access servers to make use of them.     Example                    Figure 6.11 is an example of a film and video/DVD  library organized as a client–server                                       system.     When used                Used when data in a shared database has to be accessed from a range of locations.                                       Because servers can be replicated, may also be used when the load on a system is                                       variable.     Advantages               The principal advantage of this model is that  servers can be distributed across a network.                                       General functionality (e.g., a printing service) can be available to all clients and does not                                       need to be implemented  by all  services.     Disadvantages          Each service is a single point of failure so susceptible to denial of service attacks or                                       server failure. Performance may be unpredictable because it depends on the network                                       as well as the system. May be management problems if servers are owned by different                                       organizations.                                            A   system  that   follows   the  client–server     pattern  is  organized    as a set  of  servicesFigure 6.10 Theclient–server pattern and       associated   servers,  and  clients  that  access  and use  the services.   The  major   com-                                       ponents  of  this  model   are:                                       1. A       set of  servers   that  offer   services   to  other   components.    Examples   of  servers                                               include   print   servers  that  offer   printing   services,   file  servers  that  offer   file  man-                                               agement   services,   and  a  compile    server,  which    offers   programming     language                                               compilation     services.                                       2. A      set  of  clients  that  call   on the  services  offered   by  servers.  There   will   normally                                               be  several   instances   of   a client   program    executing    concurrently      on  different                                               computers.                                       3. A      network    that  allows    the  clients   to  access  these  services.   Most   client–server                                               systems    are  implemented      as  distributed     systems,   connected     using   Internet                                               protocols.                                            Client–server     architectures   are usually   thought   of  as distributed    systems  architec-                                       tures  but  the  logical   model   of  independent   services   running   on  separate  servers  can                                       be  implemented    on a single   computer.   Again,   an important    benefit   is separation   and                                       independence.    Services  and  servers  can  be changed   without    affecting   other  parts  of                                       the  system.                                            Clients   may  have  to  know  the  names  of the  available   servers  and the  services  that                                       they  provide.    However,   servers   do  not  need  to  know   the  identity   of   clients   or  how                                       many   clients  are  accessing   their  services.

Essentially,  a client  makes a request  to a server and                                   waits until  it receives a reply.                                        Figure 6.11 is an example of a system that is based on the client–server model. This                                   is a multi-user, web-based system for providing a film and photograph library. In  this                                   system, several servers manage and display the different types of media. Video frames                                   need to be transmitted quickly and in synchrony but at relatively low resolution. They                                   may be compressed in a store, so the video server can handle video compression and                                   decompression in different formats.  Still pictures,  however, must be maintained at a                                   high resolution, so it is appropriate to maintain them on a separate server.

The data flows (as in a                                   pipe) from one component to another for processing.    Example                 Figure 6.13 is an example of a pipe and filter system used for processing invoices.    When used            Commonly used in data processing applications (both batch- and transaction-based)                                   where inputs are processed in separate stages to generate related outputs.    Advantages            Easy to understand and supports transformation reuse. Workflow style matches the                                   structure of many business processes. Evolution by adding transformations is                                   straightforward. Can be implemented as either a sequential or concurrent system.    Disadvantages       The format for data transfer has to be agreed upon between communicating                                   transformations. Each transformation must parse its input and unparse its output to the                                   agreed form. This increases system overhead and may mean that it is impossible to reuse                                   functional transformations that use incompatible data structures.180                                                                                                              6.3 \\x02 Architectural     patterns 163                                                                                    Issue                                                                                                                  Receipts                                                                                 Receipts      Read Issued                 Identify         Invoices                    Payments                                                                             Find Payments          Issue Payment            Reminders                                                                                    Due                        Reminder         Invoices                    PaymentsFigure 6.13 An           client   program  is simply   an integrated   user interface,   constructed  using  a webexample of the pipe browser,   to access these services.and filter architecture      The most important advantage of the client–server model is that it  is a distributed                                   architecture. Effective use can be made of networked systems with many distributed                                   processors. It is easy to add a new server and integrate it with the rest of the system                                   or to  upgrade  servers transparently  without   affecting   other parts  of  the system.                                    I discuss distributed  architectures, including  client–server architectures and distrib-                                   uted object architectures, in Chapter 18.                    6.3.4 Pipe         and  filter    architecture                                   My  final  example of an architectural  pattern is the pipe  and filter  pattern. This is  a                                   model of  the run-time  organization  of  a system where  functional  transformations                                   process their inputs and produce outputs. Data flows from one to another and is trans-                                   formed as it moves through the sequence. Each processing step is implemented as a                                   transform. Input  data flows through  these transforms until converted to  output. The                                   transformations may execute sequentially or in parallel. The data can be processed by                                   each transform item by item or in a single batch.                                       The name ‘pipe and filter’  comes from the original  Unix system where it was pos-                                   sible to link  processes using ‘pipes’. These passed a text stream from one process to                                   another. Systems that conform to this model can be implemented by combining Unix                                   commands, using pipes and the control facilities  of  the Unix  shell. The term ‘filter’                                   is used because a transformation ‘filters   out’  the data it can  process from its  input                                   data stream.                                       Variants of  this pattern have been in use since computers were first used for auto-                                   matic data processing. When transformations  are sequential with  data processed in                                   batches, this pipe and filter architectural model becomes a batch sequential model, a                                   common architecture for data processing systems (e.g., a billing system). The archi-                                   tecture of  an embedded system may also be organized  as a process pipeline, with                                   each process executing concurrently. I  discuss the use of this  pattern in  embedded                                   systems in Chapter 20.                                       An  example of this  type of system architecture, used in a batch processing appli-                                   cation, is  shown in Figure  6.13. An  organization  has issued invoices to customers.                                   Once a week, payments that have been made are reconciled  with  the invoices. For181164 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                   Architectural patterns for control    There are specific architectural patterns that reflect commonly used ways of organizing control in a system.    These include centralized control, based on one component calling other components, and event-based control,    where the system reacts to external events.                              http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Architecture/ArchPatterns/                                   those invoices that have been paid, a receipt is  issued. For those invoices that have                                   not been paid within the allowed  payment time, a reminder is issued.                                        Interactive systems are difficult  to  write using  the pipe and filter  model  because                                   of the  need for  a stream  of data  to be processed.  Although  simple  textual   input                                   and output can be modeled in this way, graphical user interfaces have more complex                                   I/O  formats and a control  strategy that  is based on events such as mouse clicks or                                   menu selections.  It  is  difficult   to  translate  this  into  a form  compatible   with  the                                   pipelining  model.                      6.4 Application                     architectures                                   Application  systems are intended to meet a business or organizational need. All busi-                                   nesses have much  in  common—they   need to  hire  people,  issue  invoices,  keep                                   accounts, and so on. Businesses operating in  the same sector use common  sector-                                   specific  applications.  Therefore,  as well  as general business functions,   all phone                                   companies  need systems to  connect  calls,  manage their   network,  issue  bills  to                                   customers, etc. Consequently, the application systems used by these businesses also                                   have much in common.                                        These commonalities   have led  to  the development   of software   architectures                                   that describe  the structure  and  organization  of  particular   types of  software  sys-                                   tems.  Application    architectures   encapsulate  the  principal   characteristics   of  a                                   class of systems. For example,  in real-time  systems, there might  be generic archi-                                   tectural  models   of  different   system  types,  such as  data collection    systems  or                                   monitoring   systems.  Although    instances  of  these systems  differ   in  detail,  the                                   common  architectural  structure  can be  reused when  developing  new systems  of                                   the same type.                                        The application   architecture   may  be  re-implemented   when  developing  new                                   systems but, for  many business systems, application  reuse is  possible without  re-                                   implementation.  We see this in the  growth of  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)                                   systems from  companies such as SAP and Oracle,  and vertical  software packages                                   (COTS) for  specialized applications in  different areas of business. In these systems,                                   a generic system is configured and adapted to create a specific business application.182                                                                                                   6.4 \\x02 Application     architectures 165              Application architecturesThere are several examples of application architectures on the book’s website. These include descriptions ofbatch data-processing systems, resource allocation systems, and event-based editing systems.                            http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Architecture/AppArch/                              For example, a  system for  supply chain  management can be adapted for  different                              types of suppliers, goods, and contractual arrangements.                                  As  a software designer, you can use models of application architectures in a num-                              ber of ways:                              1. As    a starting point for the architectural  design process If you are unfamiliar with                                     the type of application  that you are developing, you can base your initial  design                                     on a generic application architecture. Of  course, this will  have to be specialized                                     for the specific system being developed, but it is a good starting point for design.                              2. As    a design checklist If you have developed an architectural design for an appli-                                     cation system, you  can compare this with  the generic  application  architecture.                                     You can check that your design is consistent with the generic architecture.                              3. As    a way of organizing the work of the development team The application archi-                                     tectures identify   stable structural  features  of  the system architectures  and in                                     many cases, it is possible  to develop these in parallel.  You can assign work  to                                     group members to implement different  components within  the architecture.                              4. As    a means of  assessing components for  reuse If  you  have components  you                                     might be able to reuse, you can compare these with the generic structures to see                                     whether there are comparable components in the application architecture.                              5. As   a vocabulary for talking  about types of applications If you are discussing a spe-                                     cific application or trying  to compare applications of the same types, then you can                                     use the concepts identified in the generic architecture to talk about the applications.                                  There are many types of application system and, in some cases, they may seem to                              be very different. However,  many of these superficially dissimilar  applications  actu-                              ally have much in common, and thus can be represented by a single abstract applica-                              tion architecture.  I  illustrate  this here by  describing  the following   architectures of                              two types of application:                              1. Transaction     processing applications Transaction    processing applications   are                                     database-centered applications that  process user requests for information   and                                     update the information  in a database. These are the most common type of inter-                                     active business systems. They are organized in such a way that user actions can’t                                     interfere  with  each other and the integrity   of the database is maintained.

Language     processing  systems Language processing  systems  are systems in                                          which  the user’s intentions  are expressed in a formal  language (such as Java).                                          The language processing system processes this language into an internal format                                          and then interprets  this internal  representation. The best-known  language pro-                                          cessing systems are compilers,  which  translate high-level  language  programs                                          into  machine  code. However,  language  processing systems  are also used to                                          interpret   command  languages for   databases and information    systems,  and                                          markup languages such as XML (Harold and Means, 2002; Hunter et al., 2007).                                       I  have chosen these particular  types of system because a large number  of web-                                   based business systems are transaction-processing systems, and all software devel-                                   opment relies on language processing systems.                     6.4.1 Transaction            processing     systems                                   Transaction processing (TP) systems are designed to process user requests for infor-                                   mation  from  a  database, or requests  to  update a  database (Lewis  et  al., 2003).                                   Technically, a database transaction is sequence of operations that is treated as a sin-                                   gle unit (an atomic unit).  All  of  the operations in a transaction have to be completed                                   before the database changes are made permanent. This ensures that failure of opera-                                   tions within  the transaction does not lead to inconsistencies in the database.                                       From  a user perspective, a transaction is any coherent sequence of operations that                                   satisfies a goal, such as ‘find  the times of flights  from  London  to Paris’. If  the user                                   transaction does not require the database to be changed then it may not be necessary                                   to package this as a technical database transaction.                                       An  example of a transaction is a customer request to withdraw money from a bank                                   account using an ATM. This involves getting details of the customer’s account, check-                                   ing the balance, modifying  the balance by the amount withdrawn, and sending com-                                   mands to the ATM to deliver the cash. Until all of these steps have been completed, the                                   transaction is incomplete and the customer accounts database is not changed.                                       Transaction  processing  systems are usually  interactive  systems in which  users                                   make asynchronous requests for service.  Figure 6.14 illustrates   the conceptual ar-                                   chitectural structure  of TP  applications. First  a user makes a request to the system                                   through an I/O processing component. The request is processed by some application-                                   specific logic.  A transaction is created and passed to a transaction manager, which is                                   usually embedded in the database management system. After the transaction manager184                                                                                                        6.4 \\x02 Application     architectures 167                                             Input                                          Process                                       Output                                       Get Customer                                                                                                                                               Print Details                                         Account ID                                                                                          Query Account                                        Validate Card                                                                                  Return Card                                                                                         Update Account                                       Select Service                                                                                Dispense CashFigure 6.15 Thesoftware architecture of an ATM system                 ATM                                        Database                                        ATM                                   has ensured that the transaction is properly  completed, it  signals to the  application                                   that processing has finished.                                       Transaction  processing systems may be organized as a ‘pipe and filter’  architec-                                   ture with   system components  responsible  for  input,  processing,  and output.  For                                   example, consider a banking  system that allows  customers to query  their accounts                                   and withdraw cash from  an ATM. The system is composed of two  cooperating soft-                                   ware components—the  ATM  software and  the account processing software  in the                                   bank’s database server. The input and output components are implemented  as soft-                                   ware in the ATM and the processing component is part of the bank’s database server.                                   Figure 6.15 shows  the architecture  of this  system, illustrating  the  functions  of the                                   input, process, and output components.                    6.4.2 Information             systems                                   All  systems that involve interaction  with  a shared database can be considered to be                                   transaction-based information   systems. An  information   system allows  controlled                                   access to a large base of information, such as a library catalog, a flight  timetable, or                                   the records of patients in a hospital. Increasingly, information systems are web-based                                   systems that are accessed through a web browser.

The system is mod-                                   eled using a layered approach (discussed in Section 6.3) where the top layer supports                                   the user interface and the bottom layer is the system database. The user communica-                                   tions layer handles all input  and output from  the user interface, and the information                                   retrieval  layer  includes application-specific    logic  for  accessing and updating  the                                   database. As we shall see later, the layers in this model can map directly onto servers                                   in an Internet-based system.                                       As  an example of  an instantiation  of this  layered model,  Figure 6.17 shows  the                                   architecture of the MHC-PMS.  Recall that this system maintains and manages details                                   of patients who are consulting specialist doctors about mental health problems.

The    top layer is responsible for implementing  the user interface. In this case, the                                          UI  has been implemented using a web browser.                                   2. The     second layer  provides  the user  interface  functionality    that is  delivered                                          through the web browser. It  includes components to allow  users to log in to the                                          system and checking  components that ensure that  the operations they  use are                                          allowed by  their role.  This layer includes  form and menu management compo-                                          nents that  present information   to users, and  data validation  components  that                                          check information  consistency.                                   3. The    third layer  implements the functionality  of the system and provides compo-                                          nents that implement system security, patient information creation and updating,                                          import  and export  of patient  data from  other databases, and report generators                                          that create management reports.

Finally,     the lowest  layer, which  is built  using  a commercial database manage-                     ment system, provides transaction management and persistent data storage.                   Information and resource management systems are now usually web-based systems              where  the user  interfaces  are implemented   using  a web  browser.  For  example,               e-commerce systems are Internet-based resource management systems that accept elec-              tronic orders for goods or services and then arrange delivery of these goods or services              to the customer. In an e-commerce system, the application-specific layer includes addi-              tional functionality  supporting a ‘shopping cart’ in which  users can place a number of              items in separate transactions, then pay for them all together in a single transaction.                   The organization   of  servers  in  these systems  usually  reflects   the four-layer              generic model  presented in Figure  6.16.  These systems are often implemented  as              multi-tier  client  server/architectures, as discussed in Chapter 18:              1. The    web server is responsible for  all user communications,  with  the user inter-                     face implemented using a web browser;              2. The     application  server  is responsible  for  implementing   application-specific                     logic  as well as information storage and retrieval requests;              3. The    database server moves information  to  and from  the database and handles                     transaction management.                   Using multiple   servers allows high  throughput  and makes it  possible to handle              hundreds of transactions per minute.  As demand increases, servers can be added at              each level to cope with the extra processing involved.6.4.3 Language          processing      systems              Language processing systems translate a natural or  artificial  language into  another              representation of that language and, for  programming  languages, may also execute              the resulting code. In software engineering, compilers translate an artificial program-              ming language into machine code. Other language-processing systems may translate              an XML   data description  into  commands to  query a database or to  an alternative              XML  representation. Natural language processing systems may translate one natural              language to another e.g., French to Norwegian.                   A possible architecture for  a language processing system for a programming lan-              guage is illustrated in  Figure 6.18. The source language instructions define  the pro-              gram to be executed and a translator converts these into instructions  for an abstract              machine. These instructions are then interpreted by  another component that fetches              the instructions  for execution  and executes them using (if necessary) data from  the              environment. The  output of the  process is the result of interpreting  the instructions              on the input data.187170 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                                                                              Translator                                                        Source                    Check Syntax                                                      Language                  Check Semantics                                                     Instructions                Generate                                                                                            Abstract m/c                                                                                             Instructions                                                                                              InterpreterFigure 6.18 The                                                              Fetcharchitecture of a                               Data                       Execute                                     Resultslanguage processingsystem                                        Of course, for  many compilers,  the interpreter is  a hardware unit  that processes                                   machine instructions   and the  abstract machine  is  a real processor.  However, for                                   dynamically   typed languages,  such as Python,  the interpreter  may  be a software                                   component.                                        Programming language compilers  that are part  of a more  general programming                                   environment  have a generic architecture  (Figure  6.19) that  includes the following                                   components:                                   1. A     lexical analyzer, which  takes input  language tokens and converts them to an                                          internal form.                                   2. A    symbol  table, which holds information  about the names of entities (variables,                                          class names, object names, etc.) used in the text that is being translated.                                   3. A    syntax  analyzer, which checks the syntax of the language being translated. It                                          uses a defined grammar of the language and builds a syntax tree.                                   4. A     syntax tree,  which  is an internal   structure representing  the program  being                                          compiled.

Essentially, they includeeverything that might be in an application architecture although, in reality, it is very unlikely that any individualapplication would include all the features shown in a reference architecture. The main purpose of referencearchitectures is to evaluate and compare design proposals, and to educate people about architecturalcharacteristics in that domain.                         http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Architecture/RefArch.html                              5. A     semantic analyzer that uses information from  the syntax tree and the symbol                                     table to check the semantic correctness of the input language text.                              6. A     code generator that ‘walks’ the syntax tree and generates abstract machine code.                                   Other components might  also be included which  analyze and transform the syn-                              tax tree to  improve efficiency  and remove redundancy from  the generated machine                              code. In other types of language processing system, such as a natural language trans-                              lator,  there will   be additional  components such as a dictionary,  and the  generated                              code is actually the input  text translated into another language.                                   There are alternative  architectural patterns that  may be used in  a language pro-                              cessing system (Garlan  and Shaw, 1993).  Compilers  can be implemented  using  a                              composite of a repository  and a pipe and filter model. In a compiler architecture,  the                              symbol  table is  a repository  for  shared data. The phases of lexical,  syntactic,  and                              semantic analysis are organized sequentially, as shown in Figure 6.19,  and commu-                              nicate through the shared symbol table.                                   This pipe  and filter  model of language compilation  is effective  in batch environ-                              ments  where programs  are compiled   and executed  without  user  interaction;   for                              example,  in the  translation  of  one XML   document  to another. It  is  less effective                              when a compiler  is integrated with  other language processing tools such as a struc-                              tured  editing  system,  an interactive  debugger  or a program  prettyprinter.   In  this                              situation,  changes from  one component need to  be reflected immediately   in other                              components. It  is  better, therefore, to  organize the  system around a repository,  as                              shown in Figure  6.20.                                   This figure illustrates how a language processing system can be part of an integrated                              set of programming support tools. In this example, the symbol table and syntax tree act                              as a central information  repository. Tools or tool  fragments communicate through it.                              Other information that is sometimes embedded in tools, such as the grammar definition                              and the definition of the output format for the program, have been taken out of the tools                              and put into the repository. Therefore, a syntax-directed editor can check that the syntax                              of a program is correct as it is being typed and a prettyprinter can create listings of the                              program in a format that is easy to read.189172 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design                                                                       Lexical               Syntax            Semantic                                                                      Analyzer           Analyzer            Analyzer                                               Pretty-                         Abstract            Grammar                                                                                                                                                Optimizer                                               Printer                       Syntax Tree       Definition                                                                                   Symbol              Output                           Code                                                Editor                                                                                     Table             Definition                      GeneratorFigure 6.20 Arepository architecturefor a language                                                                       Repositoryprocessing system  KEY     POINTS       \\x02 A   software architecture is a description of  how a software system is organized.

This was the first book on        software architecture and has a good discussion on different architectural styles.  (M. Shaw and        D. Garlan, Prentice-Hall, 1996.)       Software Architecture in Practice, 2nd ed. This is a practical discussion of software architectures that       does not oversell the benefits of architectural design. It  provides a clear business rationale       explaining why architectures are important.  (L. Bass, P. Clements and R. Kazman, Addison-Wesley,       2003.)       ‘The Golden Age of Software Architecture’ This paper surveys the development of software       architecture from its beginnings in the  1980s through to its current usage. There is little technical       content but it is an interesting  historical overview. (M. Shaw and P.

This is a work in progress by Grady Booch, one of the        early evangelists for software architecture. He has been documenting the architectures of a range of       software systems so you can see reality rather than academic abstraction.

When describing a system, explain why you may have to design the system architecture                before the requirements  specification is complete.         6.2. You have been asked to prepare and deliver a presentation to a non-technical manager to                justify  the hiring of a system architect for a new project. Write a list of bullet  points setting  out                the key points  in your presentation. Naturally, you have to explain what is meant by system                architecture.         6.3. Explain why design conflicts might  arise when designing an architecture for which                 both  availability and security requirements are the most important  non-functional                requirements.         6.4. Draw diagrams showing a conceptual view and a process view of the architectures of the                following  systems:                An automated ticket-issuing  system used by passengers at a railway station.                A computer-controlled  video conferencing system that allows video, audio, and computer data                to be visible  to several participants at the same time.                A robot floor  cleaner that is intended to clean relatively clear spaces such as corridors. The                cleaner must be able to sense walls and other obstructions.191174 Chapter    6 \\x02 Architectural     design         6.5. Explain why you normally use several architectural patterns  when designing the architecture                of a large system. Apart from the information  about patterns that  I have discussed in this                chapter, what additional  information  might be useful when designing large systems?         6.6. Suggest an architecture for a system (such as iTunes) that is used to sell and distribute music                on the Internet.  What architectural patterns are the basis for this architecture?         6.7. Explain how you would use the reference model of CASE environments (available on the                book’s web pages) to compare the IDEs offered by different vendors of a programming                language such as Java.         6.8. Using the generic model of a language processing system presented here, design the                architecture  of a system that accepts natural language commands and translates these into                database queries in a language such as SQL.         6.9. Using the basic model of an information  system, as presented in Figure 6.16, suggest the                components that  might be part of an information  system that allows users to view information                about flights  arriving and departing  from a particular airport.       6.10. Should there be a separate profession of ‘software architect’ whose role  is to work                independently  with a customer to design the software system architecture? A separate                software company would  then implement the system. What might be the difficulties  of                establishing  such a profession?REFERENCES       Bass, L., Clements, P. and Kazman, R. (2003). Software Architecture in Practice, 2nd ed.

When you have read this chapter, you will:           \\x02 understand the most important activities in a general, object-              oriented design process;           \\x02 understand some of the different models that may be used to              document an object-oriented design;           \\x02 know about the idea of design patterns and how these are a way               of reusing design knowledge and experience;           \\x02 have been introduced to key issues that have to be considered when              implementing software, including software reuse and open-source              development.

For some simple systems, soft-ware design and implementation is software engineering,  and all other activities  aremerged with  this process. However, for  large systems, software design  and imple-mentation is only  one of  a set of processes (requirements engineering, verificationand validation, etc.) involved in  software engineering.    Software   design   and  implementation    activities   are  invariably    interleaved.Software design is a creative activity in which you identify  software components andtheir  relationships,   based on a  customer’s  requirements.  Implementation   is  theprocess of realizing the design as a program. Sometimes, there is  a separate designstage and this design is modeled and documented. At other times, a design is in  theprogrammer’s head or roughly  sketched on a whiteboard or sheets of paper. Designis about how  to solve a  problem, so there  is always a design  process. However, itisn’t always necessary or appropriate to describe the design in detail using the UMLor other design description language.    Design  and implementation    are closely  linked  and  you should  normally   takeimplementation issues into  account when developing  a design. For example,  usingthe UML  to document a design may be the right thing to do if  you are programmingin an object-oriented language such as Java or C#. It is less useful, I think, if you aredeveloping in a dynamically  typed language like Python and makes no sense at all ifyou are implementing your system by configuring  an off-the-shelf package. As I dis-cussed in Chapter  3, agile  methods  usually  work  from  informal   sketches  of thedesign and leave many design decisions to programmers.    One  of the most  important  implementation  decisions that  has to be made at anearly stage of a software project is whether or not you should buy or build  the appli-cation software. In  a wide range of  domains, it is now  possible to buy  off-the-shelfsystems (COTS) that  can be adapted and tailored  to  the users’  requirements. Forexample, if you want to implement a medical records system, you can buy a packagethat is already  used in hospitals.  It can  be cheaper and faster to use this  approachrather than developing a system in a conventional programming language.    When  you develop an application  in  this way, the  design process becomes con-cerned with how  to use the configuration  features of that system to deliver  the sys-tem requirements. You don’t  usually develop  design models of the system, such asmodels of  the  system objects  and their  interactions.   I  discuss this  COTS-basedapproach to development in Chapter 16.    I  assume that most  readers of  this book  will   have had experience  of  programdesign and implementation. This  is something that you acquire  as you learn to pro-gram and master the elements of a programming language like Java or Python. Youwill  have probably  learned about good programming  practice  in the  programminglanguages that you have studied, as well  as how  to debug programs that  you havedeveloped. Therefore, I don’t  cover programming  topics  here. Instead, this chapterhas two aims:1. To    show how system modeling  and architectural design (covered in Chapters 5       and 6) are put into practice in developing an object-oriented  software design.195178 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation       FPO Structured   design methods    Structured design methods propose that software design should be tackled in a methodical way. Designing a    system involves following the steps of the method and refining the design of a system at increasingly detailed    levels. In the 1990s, there were a number of competing methods for object-oriented design. However, the    inventors of the most commonly used methods came together and invented the UML, which unified the    notations used in the different methods.    Rather than focus on methods, most discussions now are about processes where design is seen as part of the    overall software development process. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a good example of a generic    development process.                                   http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Structured-methods/                                   2. To    introduce  important  implementation  issues that  are not usually  covered in                                          programming  books. These include software reuse, configuration management,                                          and open source development.                                        As there are a vast number of different development platforms,  the chapter is not                                   biased towards any particular programming language or implementation technology.                                   Therefore, I  have presented all examples using the UML   rather than in a program-                                   ming language such as Java or Python.                        7.1 Object-oriented                        design         using        the     UML                                   An object-oriented  system is made up of interacting objects that  maintain their own                                   local state and provide operations on that state. The representation of the state is pri-                                   vate and cannot be accessed directly from outside the object. Object-oriented design                                   processes involve  designing   object  classes and the  relationships  between  these                                   classes. These classes define the objects in the system and their interactions. When                                   the design is realized as an executing program,  the objects are created dynamically                                   from these class definitions.                                        Object-oriented systems are easier to change than systems developed using func-                                   tional approaches. Objects include both data and operations to manipulate that data.                                   They may therefore be understood and modified as stand-alone entities. Changing the                                   implementation of an object or adding services should not affect other system objects.                                   Because objects are associated with things, there is often a clear mapping between real-                                   world entities (such as hardware components) and their controlling objects in the sys-                                   tem. This improves the understandability, and hence the maintainability, of the design.                                        To develop a  system design from   concept to  detailed,  object-oriented  design,                                   there are several things that you need to do:                                   1. Understand    and define the context and the external interactions with the system.                                   2. Design    the system architecture.196                                                             7.1 \\x02 Object-oriented     design using  the UML 179            3. Identify      the principal objects in  the system.            4. Develop     design models.            5. Specify     interfaces.                 Like   all creative  activities,   design  is not  a clear-cut,  sequential  process. You            develop a design by  getting ideas, proposing solutions,  and refining  these solutions            as information  becomes available. You inevitably  have to backtrack and retry  when            problems arise. Sometimes you explore options in  detail to see if they work; at other            times  you ignore  details until  late in the  process. Consequently, I have deliberately            not illustrated  this process as a simple diagram because that would imply design can            be thought  of as a neat sequence of activities. In  fact, all  of the above activities  are            interleaved and so influence each other.                 I  illustrate these process activities by designing part of the software for the wilder-            ness weather station that I  introduced in Chapter 1.  Wilderness weather stations are            deployed in remote areas. Each weather station records local weather information and            periodically  transfers this to a weather information system, using a satellite link.7.1.1 System        context    and   interactions            The  first stage in any software  design process is to develop an understanding of the            relationships  between the software  that is being  designed and its external environ-            ment. This  is essential for deciding how to provide  the required system functionality            and how to structure the system to communicate with its environment. Understanding            of  the context also lets you establish the boundaries of the system.                 Setting  the system boundaries helps you  decide what features are implemented            in  the system being designed and what  features are in other associated systems. In            this  case, you need to  decide how functionality   is  distributed  between the control            system  for all  of  the weather  stations, and the embedded software  in  the weather            station  itself.                 System context  models and interaction models  present complementary views of            the relationships between a system and its environment:            1. A     system context  model is  a structural model  that demonstrates the other sys-                    tems in the environment of the system being developed.            2. An     interaction  model is  a dynamic model  that shows how the system interacts                    with its environment  as it is used.                 The context model of a system may be represented using associations. Associations            simply  show  that there are some relationships  between the entities involved  in  the            association. The nature of the relationships is now specified. You may therefore docu-            ment the environment of the system using a simple block diagram, showing the entities            in  the system and their associations. This is illustrated in Figure 7.1, which shows that197180 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                      Weather station use cases         Report weather—send weather data to the weather information system         Report status—send status information to the weather information system         Restart—if the weather station is shut down, restart the system         Shutdown—shut down the weather station         Reconfigure—reconfigure the weather station software         Powersave—put the weather station into power-saving mode         Remote control—send control commands to any weather station subsystem                                    http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/WS/Usecases.html                                   the systems in the environment of each weather station are a weather information sys-                                   tem, an onboard satellite system, and a control system. The cardinality information on                                   the link shows that there is one control system but several weather stations, one satellite,                                   and one general weather information system.                                       When  you model the interactions of a system with its environment you should use                                   an abstract approach that does not include too much detail. One way to  do this is to                                   use a use case model. As I discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, each use case represents an                                   interaction with  the system. Each possible interaction is named in an ellipse and the                                   external entity involved  in the interaction is represented by a stick figure.                                       The  use case model for  the weather station is  shown in  Figure 7.2.  This shows                                   that the  weather station  interacts  with  the  weather information    system to  report                                   weather data and the status of the weather  station hardware. Other interactions  are                                   with a control  system that can issue specific weather station control commands. As I                                   explained in Chapter 5, a stick figure  is used in the UML  to represent other systems                                   as well as human users.                                       Each of  these use cases should be described in structured natural language. This                                   helps designers identify  objects in  the system and gives  them an understanding of                                   what the system is  intended to do.  I use a standard format  for this  description that                                   clearly identifies  what information  is exchanged, how the interaction is initiated, and                                                                                        1      Control      1                                                                                                System                                                                          1                                                   1..n                                                                      Weather                                                                                         1                 1..n       Weather                                                                   Information                                                                                                                          Station                                                                      System                                                                          1                                                   1..nFigure 7.1 Systemcontext for the weather                                                   1 Satellite 1station198                                                                                   7.1 \\x02 Object-oriented     design using  the UML 181                                                                                                         Report                                                                                                        Weather                                                                                                         Report                                                                   Weather                         Status                                                                 Information                                                                    System                                                                                                         Restart                                                                                                       Shutdown                                                                                                      Reconfigure                                                                    Control                                                                    System                      Powersave                                                                                                        RemoteFigure 7.2 Weather                                                                          Controlstation use cases                                   so on.

The data sent                                  are the maximum, minimum, and average ground and air temperatures; the maximum,                                  minimum, and average air pressures; the maximum, minimum, and average wind speeds;                                  the total rainfall; and the wind direction as sampled at five-minute intervals.    Stimulus                The weather information system establishes a satellite communication link with the                                  weather station and requests transmission of the data.    Response              The summarized data are sent to the weather information system.    Comments             Weather stations are usually asked to report once per hour but this frequency may differ                                  from one station to another and may be modified in the future.199182 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                                  «subsystem»                     «subsystem»                      «subsystem»                                                 Fault Manager             Configuration Manager           Power Manager                                                                                       Communication LinkFigure 7.4 High-level                 «subsystem»                     «subsystem»                     «subsystem»architecture of the                  Communications                 Data Collection                    Instrumentsweather station                                   You identify  the major  components that make up the system and their  interactions,                                   and then may organize the components using an architectural pattern such as a lay-                                   ered or client–server model. However, this is not essential at this stage.                                        The high-level  architectural  design for  the weather station software  is shown in                                   Figure 7.4. The  weather station is composed of  independent subsystems that com-                                   municate  by  broadcasting  messages on a common   infrastructure,   shown  as the                                   Communication   link  in  Figure  7.4. Each subsystem  listens for  messages on that                                   infrastructure    and picks   up  the messages  that  are intended   for  them.  This   is                                   another  commonly   used  architectural    style  in  addition   to  those  described   in                                   Chapter 6.                                        For example,  when  the  communications   subsystem  receives  a control  com-                                   mand, such as shutdown,  the command is  picked up  by each of  the other subsys-                                   tems, which  then shut themselves down in  the correct way. The key  benefit of  this                                   architecture  is  that  it  is easy to  support  different   configurations   of  subsystems                                   because the sender of a message does not need to address the message to a partic-                                   ular subsystem.                                        Figure  7.5 shows  the architecture  of  the  data collection   subsystem, which   is                                   included  in Figure  7.4.  The Transmitter  and Receiver  objects are concerned with                                   managing communications and the WeatherData object encapsulates the information                                   that is  collected from  the  instruments and  transmitted to  the weather  information                                   system. This  arrangement  follows   the  producer-consumer  pattern,  discussed  in                                   Chapter 20.                     7.1.3 Object         class   identification                                   By this  stage in the  design process, you should  have some ideas about the  essen-                                   tial  objects  in  the system  that you  are designing.   As your  understanding   of the                                   design develops,  you  refine  these ideas  about the  system objects.  The  use case                                   description   helps  to  identify    objects  and  operations  in  the  system.  From   the                                   description  of the Report  weather use case, it is  obvious that  objects representing                                   the  instruments   that  collect   weather  data  will   be  required,   as will   an  object                                   representing the summary  of the weather  data. You also usually  need a high-level200                                                                                   7.1 \\x02 Object-oriented     design using  the UML 183                                                                        Data Collection                                                                             Transmitter                 ReceiverFigure 7.5 Architecture                                                        WeatherDataof data collectionsystem                                   system object  or  objects that  encapsulate the  system interactions   defined  in  the                                   use cases. With these objects in  mind,  you can start  to identify   the object  classes                                   in the system.                                       There  have been various proposals made about how to identify  object  classes in                                   object-oriented systems:                                   1. Use    a grammatical analysis of a natural language description of the system to be                                          constructed. Objects and attributes  are nouns; operations or services are verbs                                          (Abbott,  1983).                                   2. Use    tangible  entities (things)  in  the application  domain  such as aircraft,  roles                                          such as manager or doctor, events such as requests, interactions such as meet-                                          ings,  locations  such as offices,  organizational   units  such as companies,  and                                           so  on  (Coad  and  Yourdon,   1990;  Shlaer  and  Mellor,   1988;   Wirfs-Brock                                           et al., 1990).                                   3. Use    a scenario-based analysis where various scenarios of system use are identi-                                          fied and analyzed in turn. As each scenario is analyzed, the team responsible for                                          the analysis must identify  the required objects, attributes, and operations (Beck                                          and Cunningham, 1989).                                       In  practice, you have to use several knowledge sources to discover object classes.                                   Object classes, attributes, and operations that are initially  identified  from  the infor-                                   mal system description  can be a starting  point  for  the design. Further  information                                   from application  domain knowledge or  scenario analysis may then be used to refine                                   and extend the initial  objects. This  information  can be collected from  requirements                                   documents, discussions with users, or from analyses of existing systems.                                       In  the wilderness  weather station,  object identification   is based on the  tangible                                   hardware in the system. I don’t have space to include all the system objects here, but                                   I  have  shown   five   object   classes  in  Figure   7.6.   The  Ground   thermometer,                                   Anemometer,  and  Barometer   objects  are  application   domain  objects,   and  the                                   WeatherStation  and WeatherData  objects  have  been identified   from  the  system                                   description and the scenario (use case) description:                                   1.

Its operations  reflect  the  interactions  shown in201184 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                                                 WeatherStation                           WeatherData                                                        identifier                                    airTemperatures                                                                                                          groundTemperatures                                                        reportWeather ( )                       windSpeeds                                                        reportStatus ( )                          windDirections                                                        powerSave (instruments)          pressures                                                        remoteControl (commands)      rainfall                                                        reconfigure (commands)                                                        restart (instruments)                  collect ( )                                                        shutdown (instruments)             summarize ( )                                                                Ground                 Anemometer              Barometer                                                           Thermometer                                                                                          an_Ident                   bar_Ident                                                         gt_Ident                    windSpeed               pressure                                                         temperature             windDirection            height                                                         get ( )                        get ( )                       get ( )Figure 7.6 Weather                          test ( )                       test ( )                       test ( ) station objects                                          Figure  7.3. In  this case, I use a single  object  class to encapsulate all  of these                                          interactions,  but in other designs you could  design the system interface as sev-                                          eral different  classes.                                   2. The    WeatherData object  class is responsible for  processing the report weather                                          command. It sends the summarized data from the weather station instruments to                                          the weather information  system.                                   3. The     Ground  thermometer,  Anemometer,   and  Barometer  object  classes are                                          directly  related  to instruments  in  the system.  They reflect  tangible  hardware                                          entities  in the  system and the  operations are concerned  with  controlling   that                                          hardware. These objects operate autonomously  to collect  data at the specified                                          frequency  and store  the collected   data locally.  This  data  is delivered  to  the                                          WeatherData object on request.                                        You use knowledge of the application domain to identify  other objects, attributes,                                   and services. We know that weather stations are often located  in remote places and                                   include various instruments that sometimes go wrong. Instrument  failures should be                                   reported automatically. This implies  that you need attributes and operations to check                                   the correct functioning  of  the instruments. There are many remote weather stations                                   so each weather station should have its own identifier.                                        At this stage in the design process, you should focus on the objects themselves, with-                                   out thinking  about how  these might be implemented.  Once you have identified  the                                   objects, you then refine  the object  design. You look  for common  features and then                                   design the inheritance hierarchy  for  the system. For example, you  may identify   an                                   Instrument superclass, which defines the common features of all instruments, such as an                                   identifier, and get and test operations. You may also add new attributes and operations to                                   the superclass, such as an attribute that maintains the frequency of data collection.202                                                             7.1 \\x02 Object-oriented     design  using the UML 1857.1.4 Design        models             Design or system models, as I discussed in Chapter 5, show the objects or object classes             in a system. They also show the associations and relationships between these entities.             These models are the bridge between the system requirements and the implementation             of a system. They have to be abstract so that unnecessary detail doesn’t hide the rela-             tionships  between them and the  system requirements. However,  they also  have to             include enough detail for programmers to make implementation decisions.                  Generally, you get around this  type of conflict  by  developing models at different             levels of detail. Where there are close links between requirements engineers, design-             ers, and programmers,  then abstract models may  be all  that are required.  Specific             design decisions may be made as the system is implemented, with problems resolved             through informal  discussions. When the links  between system specifiers, designers,             and programmers are indirect (e.g., where a system is being designed in one part of             an organization but implemented elsewhere), then more detailed models are likely to             be needed.                  An  important  step in  the design  process, therefore,  is to  decide on the  design             models that you need and the level of  detail required in  these models. This depends             on the type of  system that is being developed. You design a sequential data-process-             ing system in  a different way from  an embedded real-time system, so you will  need             different  design models.  The UML  supports  13 different  types of  models but, as I             discussed in Chapter 5, you rarely  use all of these. Minimizing   the number of mod-             els that are produced reduces the costs of the design and the time  required to com-             plete the design process.                  When you use the UML to develop a design, you will  normally develop two kinds             of design model:             1. Structural     models, which describe the static structure of the system using object                    classes and their relationships. Important relationships that may  be documented                    at this  stage are generalization  (inheritance)  relationships,  uses/used-by rela-                    tionships, and composition  relationships.             2. Dynamic     models, which describe the dynamic structure of the system and show                    the  interactions  between the  system objects.  Interactions  that  may  be docu-                    mented include  the sequence of service requests made by objects and the state                    changes that are triggered by these object interactions.                  In the  early stages of the design process, I  think there  are three models that are             particularly  useful for  adding detail to use case and architectural models:             1. Subsystem    models, which  that show logical  groupings of  objects into coherent                    subsystems. These are represented using a form of class diagram with each sub-                    system shown as a package with enclosed objects. Subsystem models are static                    (structural)  models.203186 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                           Weather                   Information System                                                        :SatComms        :WeatherStation        :Commslink           :WeatherData                                    request (report)                                       acknowledge                                                                  reportWeather ( )                                                                      acknowledge                                                                                                   get (summary)        summarize ( )                                                                      send (report)                                                                      acknowledge                                       reply (report)                                       acknowledge                                   2. Sequence    models, which  show the  sequence of object interactions.  These areFigure 7.7 Sequencediagram describing            represented using  a  UML   sequence or  a collaboration    diagram.  Sequencedata collection                   models are dynamic models.                                   3. State    machine model, which  show how  individual  objects change their state in                                          response to events. These  are represented in  the UML   using state diagrams.                                          State machine models are dynamic models.                                        A subsystem model is a useful static model as it shows how a design is organized into                                   logically related groups of objects. I have already shown this type of model in Figure 7.4                                   to show the subsystems in the weather mapping system. As well as subsystem models,                                   you may also design detailed object models, showing all of the objects in the systems                                   and their associations (inheritance, generalization, aggregation, etc.). However, there is                                   a danger in doing too much modeling. You should not make detailed decisions about the                                   implementation that really should be left to the system programmers.                                        Sequence models are dynamic models that describe, for each mode of interaction,                                   the sequence of object interactions that take place. When documenting a design, you                                   should produce a sequence model for each significant interaction. If you have devel-                                   oped a use case model then there should be a sequence model for each use case that                                   you have identified.                                        Figure 7.7 is  an example of  a sequence model, shown as a UML  sequence dia-                                   gram. This  diagram  shows the  sequence of  interactions  that take  place when  an                                   external system requests the summarized  data from  the weather  station. You read                                   sequence diagrams from top to bottom:                                   1. The    SatComms object receives a request from  the weather information  system                                          to collect  a weather  report from  a weather station.  It acknowledges  receipt of204                                                7.1 \\x02 Object-oriented     design using  the UML 187       this request. The stick arrowhead on the sent message indicates that the external       system does not wait for a reply but can carry on with  other processing.2. SatComms    sends a message to WeatherStation, via a satellite  link,  to create a       summary of  the collected  weather data.  Again,  the stick  arrowhead indicates       that SatComms does not suspend itself waiting for a reply.3. WeatherStation     sends a  message to a  Commslink   object  to  summarize  the       weather data. In this case, the squared-off style of  arrowhead indicates that the       instance of the WeatherStation object class waits for a reply.4. Commslink    calls the summarize method in the object WeatherData and waits for       a reply.5. The    weather data summary is computed and returned to WeatherStation via the       Commslink  object.6. WeatherStation     then calls  the SatComms  object  to transmit  the  summarized       data to the weather  information  system, through  the satellite  communications       system.    The  SatComms and WeatherStation objects may  be implemented as concurrentprocesses, whose execution can be suspended and resumed. The SatComms objectinstance listens for messages from the external system, decodes these messages andinitiates weather station operations.    Sequence diagrams  are  used to  model  the combined   behavior  of  a group  ofobjects but you may also want to summarize the behavior of an object or a subsystemin response to messages and events. To do this, you can use a state machine modelthat shows how the object instance changes state depending on the messages that itreceives. The UML   includes state diagrams,  initially   invented by  Harel  (1987) todescribe state machine models.    Figure  7.8 is  a state diagram  for the  weather station  system that shows  how itresponds to requests for various services.    You can read this diagram as follows:1. If    the system state is Shutdown then it can respond to a restart(), a reconfigure(),       or a powerSave() message. The unlabeled arrow  with  the black blob  indicates       that the Shutdown state is the initial state. A restart() message causes a transition       to normal operation.  Both the powerSave() and reconfigure()  messages cause a       transition to  a state in which  the system reconfigures  itself.  The state diagram       shows that reconfiguration is only  allowed if  the system has been shut down.2. In    the Running state, the system expects further messages. If a shutdown() mes-       sage is received, the object returns to the shutdown state.3. If    a reportWeather() message is received, the system moves to the Summarizing       state. When the summary is complete, the system moves to a Transmitting state       where the information  is transmitted to the remote system. It then returns to the       Running state.205188 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                                                                    Controlled                                                                     Operation                                             shutdown ( )                            remoteControl ( )                                                           restart ( )                                reportStatus ( )                                Shutdown                                     Running                                        Testing                                                                                                          transmission done                                                                                                                                                 test complete                  reconfigure ( )         configuration done                  powerSave ( )                                                                               clock collection                                                                                             done                                  Transmitting                               Configuring                                   Collecting                 reportWeather ( )                                                                                                                                                 weather                                                                                                                                                 summary                                                                                                                                                 complete                                                                                                          Summarizing                                   4. If     a reportStatus()  message is received, the system moves to the Testing state,Figure 7.8 Weatherstation state diagram         then the Transmitting state, before returning to the Running  state.                                   5. If     a signal from  the clock is  received, the system moves to the Collecting state,                                          where it  collects data from the instruments. Each instrument is instructed in turn                                          to collect  its data from the associated sensors.                                   6. If     a remoteControl() message is received, the system moves to a controlled state                                          in  which  it  responds to  a different   set of  messages from the  remote control                                          room.  These are not shown on this diagram.                                        State diagrams are useful high-level models of  a system or an object’s operation.                                   You don’t  usually need a state diagram for all  of the objects in the system. Many  of                                   the objects  in  a system are relatively   simple and  a state model  adds unnecessary                                   detail to  the design.                      7.1.5 Interface         specification                                   An important  part of any design process is the specification of the interfaces between                                   the components in the design. You need to specify interfaces so that objects and sub-                                   systems can be designed in parallel. Once an interface has been specified, the devel-                                   opers of other objects may assume that interface will  be implemented.                                        Interface  design is  concerned with   specifying  the detail  of  the interface  to  an                                   object or  to a group of objects. This means defining  the signatures and semantics of206                                                                                                                        7.2 \\x02 Design   patterns 189                                                                                                                            «interface»                                                               «interface»                                                                                                                        Remote Control                                                                Reporting                                                                                                          startInstrument (instrument): iStatus                                             weatherReport (WS-Ident): Wreport                                                                                                          stopInstrument (instrument): iStatus                                             statusReport (WS-Ident): Sreport                                                                                                          collectData (instrument): iStatusFigure 7.9 Weather                                                                                                          provideData (instrument): stringstation interfaces                                   the services that are provided by the object or by a group of objects. Interfaces can be                                   specified in the UML   using the same notation as a class diagram. However, there is                                   no attribute section  and the UML  stereotype ‹‹interface›› should  be included in  the                                   name part. The semantics of the interface may be defined using the object constraint                                   language (OCL). I  explain this  in Chapter 17, where I cover  component-based soft-                                   ware engineering. I also show an alternative way to represent interfaces in the UML.                                       You  should not include  details of  the data representation in  an interface design,                                   as attributes  are not  defined  in  an interface  specification.   However,  you  should                                   include operations to access and update data. As the data representation is hidden, it                                   can be easily changed without  affecting the objects that  use that data. This leads to                                   a design that is inherently  more maintainable. For example,  an array representation                                   of a  stack may be changed to  a list  representation without  affecting  other  objects                                   that use the stack.  By  contrast, it  often  makes sense to expose the attributes  in  a                                   static design model, as this is the most compact way of illustrating  essential charac-                                   teristics of  the objects.                                       There  is not a simple  1:1 relationship  between objects and interfaces. The same                                   object may have several interfaces, each of which is a viewpoint on the methods that                                   it provides.  This  is supported directly  in  Java, where interfaces are declared  sepa-                                   rately from  objects and objects ‘implement’   interfaces. Equally,  a group of  objects                                   may all be accessed through a single interface.                                       Figure  7.9 shows two interfaces that may be defined for  the weather station. The                                   left-hand interface  is a reporting  interface that defines the operation  names that are                                   used to generate weather and status reports. These map directly to operations in the                                   WeatherStation object. The remote control interface provides four operations, which                                   map onto a single method  in the WeatherStation object.  In this case, the individual                                   operations are encoded in  the command  string associated with  the  remoteControl                                   method, shown in Figure 7.6.                       7.2 Design               patterns                                   Design  patterns were  derived from   ideas put  forward  by  Christopher  Alexander                                   (Alexander et al., 1977),  who suggested that there were certain common patterns of                                   building design that were inherently pleasing and effective. The pattern is a description                                   of the problem  and the essence of its solution, so that the solution may be reused in207190 Chapter        7 \\x02 Design      and  implementation     Pattern name:  Observer     Description:  Separates the display of the state of an object from  the object itself and  allows alternative displays          to  be provided. When the object state changes, all displays are automatically notified and updated  to reflect          the  change.     Problem  description:  In many situations, you  have to provide multiple  displays of state information,           such as a graphical display and a tabular display. Not all of these may be known  when the information  is          specified. All alternative presentations should  support interaction  and, when the state is changed, all displays          must  be updated.          This pattern may be used in all  situations where more than  one display format for state information  is          required  and where it is not  necessary for the object that maintains the state information  to know  about the          specific display formats used.     Solution  description:   This involves two abstract objects, Subject and Observer, and two concrete objects,          ConcreteSubject and ConcreteObject, which inherit  the attributes of the related  abstract objects. The abstract          objects include  general operations that are applicable in all  situations. The state to be displayed is          maintained  in ConcreteSubject, which inherits operations from  Subject allowing it  to add and remove          Observers (each observer corresponds to a display) and to issue a notification  when the state has changed.          The ConcreteObserver maintains a copy of the state of ConcreteSubject and implements the Update()          interface of  Observer that allows these copies to be kept in step. The ConcreteObserver automatically          displays the state and reflects changes whenever the state is updated.          The UML model of  the pattern is shown in  Figure 7.12.     Consequences: The subject only knows the  abstract Observer and does not know details of the concrete class.          Therefore there is minimal  coupling between  these objects. Because of this lack of knowledge, optimizations          that  enhance display performance are impractical. Changes to the subject may cause a set of linked updates          to  observers to be generated, some of which may not be necessary.                                       different   settings.

Patterns   have made  a huge  impact   on  object-oriented    software   design.   As  well  as                                       being  tested  solutions   to  common  problems,   they  have  become  a vocabulary    for  talk-                                       ing  about  a  design.  You  can  therefore  explain   your   design  by  describing   the  patterns                                       that  you  have  used.  This   is particularly     true  for  the  best-known    design  patterns   that                                       were  originally    described  by  the ‘Gang   of  Four’  in  their  patterns  book,  (Gamma   et al.,                                       1995).  Other  particularly    important    pattern  descriptions   are those  published  in  a series                                       of    books    by   authors    from    Siemens,     a  large    European     technology      company                                        (Buschmann   et  al., 1996;   Buschmann   et al., 2007a;   Buschmann   et al.,  2007b;  Kircher                                       and  Jain, 2004;   Schmidt   et al.,  2000).                                            Design    patterns   are  usually    associated   with   object-oriented      design.

So, you could                                   have configuration  patterns  for  COTS systems. Patterns are a  way of  reusing the                                   knowledge and experience of other designers.                                       The four  essential elements of design patterns were defined by the ‘Gang of Four’                                   in their patterns book:                                   1. A    name that is a meaningful reference to the pattern.                                   2. A     description   of  the  problem  area  that explains   when  the pattern  may  be                                          applied.                                   3. A    solution  description of the parts of the design solution, their relationships, and                                          their responsibilities.  This  is not a concrete design description.  It  is a template                                          for  a design solution  that  can be instantiated  in  different  ways.  This is  often                                          expressed graphically   and shows  the relationships   between  the objects  and                                          object classes in the solution.                                   4. A     statement of the consequences—the results and trade-offs—of  applying  the                                          pattern. This can help designers understand whether or not a pattern can be used                                          in a particular situation.                                       Gamma  and his co-authors break down  the problem description  into  motivation                                    (a description of why the pattern is useful) and applicability (a description of situations                                   in which the pattern may be used). Under the description of the solution, they describe                                   the pattern structure, participants, collaborations, and implementation.                                       To  illustrate pattern description,  I use the Observer pattern, taken from  the book                                   by Gamma et al. (Gamma et al., 1995). This is shown in Figure  7.10. In my descrip-                                   tion, I  use the four essential description elements and also include a brief  statement                                   of what  the pattern  can do. This  pattern can be used in  situations  where different                                   presentations of an object’s  state are required. It  separates the object that  must be                                   displayed from the different  forms of  presentation. This is illustrated in  Figure 7.11,                                   which shows two graphical  presentations of the same data set.                                       Graphical   representations are normally   used to  illustrate  the object  classes in                                   patterns and their  relationships.

Examples of such                                   problems, documented in the ‘Gang of Four’s  original patterns book, include:                                   1. Tell     several objects that the state of  some other object  has changed (Observer                                          pattern).                                   2. Tidy    up the interfaces to a number of related objects that have often been devel-                                          oped incrementally (Façade pattern).                                   3. Provide    a standard way of accessing the elements in a collection, irrespective of                                          how that collection  is implemented (Iterator  pattern).                                   4. Allow      for the  possibility  of  extending the functionality   of  an existing  class at                                          run-time (Decorator  pattern).                                       Patterns  support high-level,   concept  reuse. When  you try  to  reuse executable                                   components you are inevitably   constrained by  detailed design decisions  that have                                   been made  by  the  implementers   of  these  components.  These  range  from   the                                   particular   algorithms  that  have been  used to  implement  the  components  to  the                                   objects and types in  the component  interfaces.  When these design decisions  con-                                   flict    with   your    particular    requirements,    reusing   the   component    is  either                                   impossible  or  introduces  inefficiencies   into  your  system.  Using  patterns  means                                   that you  reuse the ideas but can  adapt the implementation   to suit  the system that                                   you are developing.                                       When  you start designing a system, it can be difficult  to know, in  advance, if you                                   will  need a particular   pattern. Therefore,  using patterns in  a design  process often                                   involves developing  a design, experiencing a problem,  and then recognizing  that a                                   pattern can be used. This is certainly possible if you focus on the 23 general-purpose210                                                                                      7.3 \\x02 Implementation      issues 193             patterns documented in the original patterns book. However, if your problem is a dif-             ferent one, you may  find it  difficult  to  find an appropriate pattern amongst the hun-             dreds of different  patterns that have been proposed.                  Patterns are a great idea but you need experience of software design to use them             effectively.   You  have  to  recognize  situations   where  a  pattern  can be  applied.             Inexperienced programmers,  even if they  have read the pattern books, will   always             find  it hard to decide whether they  can reuse a pattern or need to develop a special-             purpose solution. 7.3 Implementation                         issues             Software engineering includes all  of the activities involved  in software development             from  the initial   requirements  of the  system through  to maintenance and  manage-             ment of  the deployed system. A  critical  stage of  this process is, of  course, system             implementation,    where   you   create   an  executable   version   of   the   software.             Implementation may involve developing programs in high- or low-level programming             languages or tailoring and adapting generic, off-the-shelf systems to meet the specific             requirements of an organization.                  I assume that most readers of this book will   understand programming principles             and will  have some programming  experience. As this chapter is  intended to offer  a             language-independent approach, I haven’t  focused on issues of good programming             practice  as this has to  use language-specific  examples. Instead, I  introduce  some             aspects of implementation   that are particularly   important  to software  engineering             that are often not covered in programming  texts. These are:             1. Reuse Most    modern software is  constructed by reusing existing components or                    systems. When you  are developing software, you  should make as much use as                    possible of existing  code.             2. Configuration      management During   the development  process, many different                    versions  of each software  component  are created. If  you  don’t  keep track  of                    these versions in a configuration  management system, you are liable to include                    the wrong versions of  these components in your system.             3. Host-target     development Production  software does not  usually execute on the                    same computer as the software development environment. Rather, you  develop                    it  on one computer (the host system) and execute it on a separate computer (the                    target system). The host and target systems are sometimes of the same type but,                    often they are completely  different.7.3.1 Reuse             From  the 1960s to the  1990s, most new software  was developed from  scratch, by             writing  all code in a high-level  programming language. The only significant  reuse or211194 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                   software was the reuse of functions and objects in  programming  language libraries.                                   However, costs and schedule pressure meant that this approach became increasingly                                   unviable, especially  for  commercial  and Internet-based systems. Consequently, an                                   approach to development based around the reuse of existing software emerged and is                                   now generally  used for  business systems, scientific software,  and, increasingly,  in                                   embedded systems engineering.                                       Software  reuse is possible at a number of different levels:                                   1. The    abstraction  level At  this level, you  don’t reuse software directly  but rather                                          use knowledge of successful abstractions in the design of your software. Design                                          patterns and architectural patterns (covered in Chapter 6) are ways of represent-                                          ing abstract knowledge for  reuse.                                   2. The    object  level At  this  level, you  directly  reuse objects from  a library  rather                                          than writing  the code yourself. To implement this type of reuse, you have to find                                          appropriate libraries and discover if  the objects and methods offer the function-                                          ality  that you need. For example, if you need to process mail messages in a Java                                          program, you may use objects and methods from a JavaMail library.                                   3. The    component level Components are collections  of  objects and object classes                                          that operate together to provide related functions and services. You often have to                                          adapt and extend the component by adding some code of your own. An example                                          of component-level  reuse is where you build your  user interface using a frame-                                          work.  This is a set of general object classes that implement event handling, dis-                                          play  management, etc.  You add connections  to  the data to  be displayed  and                                          write  code to define specific display details such as screen layout and colors.                                   4. The    system level At this level, you reuse entire application systems. This usually                                          involves  some kind  of  configuration   of these systems.  This may  be done by                                          adding and modifying   code (if  you  are reusing a software  product line)  or  by                                          using the system’s  own configuration  interface.  Most  commercial systems are                                          now built  in  this way where  generic COTS (commercial  off-the-shelf)  systems                                          are adapted and reused. Sometimes this approach may involve  reusing several                                          different  systems and integrating these to create a new system.                                       By  reusing  existing software,  you can develop new  systems more quickly,  with                                   fewer development risks and also lower costs. As the reused software has been tested                                   in other applications,  it  should be more reliable  than new software. However, there                                   are costs associated with reuse:                                   1. The     costs of  the time  spent  in  looking   for  software  to  reuse and assessing                                          whether or not  it meets your needs. You may have to test the software to  make                                          sure that it will  work  in your  environment, especially if  this is different  from its                                          development environment.                                   2. Where    applicable,  the costs of buying  the reusable software. For large off-the-                                          shelf systems, these costs can be very high.212                                                                                       7.3 \\x02 Implementation     issues 195             3. The     costs of adapting and configuring the reusable software components or sys-                     tems to reflect the requirements of the system that you are developing.             4. The     costs of integrating  reusable software elements with each other (if  you are                     using software  from  different   sources) and with  the  new code that  you have                     developed. Integrating reusable software  from different  providers  can be diffi-                     cult  and expensive because the providers  may make  conflicting   assumptions                     about how their respective software will  be reused.                  How  to reuse existing knowledge and software should be the first thing you should             think  about when  starting a software development project.  You should consider the             possibilities  of reuse before designing the software in detail, as you may wish to adapt             your  design to reuse existing software assets. As I discussed in Chapter 2, in a reuse-             oriented  development process, you  search for reusable elements then modify  your             requirements and design to make best use of these.                  For  a large number  of  application  systems, software  engineering really  means             software  reuse. I therefore devote several chapters in the software technologies sec-             tion  of the book to this  topic (Chapters 16, 17, and 19).7.3.2 Configuration            management             In  software  development, change happens all  the time,  so change management is             absolutely  essential. When  a team of people  are developing software,  you have to             make sure that team members don’t interfere  with each others’ work.  That is, if  two             people are working on a component, their changes have to be coordinated. Otherwise,             one programmer may make changes and overwrite the other’s work. You also have to             ensure that everyone can access the most up-to-date versions of software components,             otherwise  developers may redo work  that has already been done. When  something             goes wrong with  a new version of a system, you have to be able to go back to a work-             ing  version of the system or component.                  Configuration  management is the name given to the general process of managing             a changing software system. The aim of  configuration  management is to support the             system integration process so that all developers can access the project code and doc-             uments in a controlled  way, find out what changes have been made, and compile and             link  components to create a system. There are, therefore, three fundamental configu-             ration  management activities:             1. Version     management, where support is  provided to  keep track of  the different                     versions of software  components. Version management systems include facili-                     ties to coordinate  development by  several programmers. They stop one devel-                     oper overwriting  code that has been submitted to the system by someone else.             2. System     integration,  where support is  provided  to help developers define  what                     versions  of  components  are used  to create  each version  of   a system.  This                     description is then used to build  a system automatically by  compiling  and link-                     ing the required components.213196 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                   3. Problem    tracking,  where support is  provided to  allow  users to report bugs and                                          other problems, and to allow all developers to see who is working on these prob-                                          lems and when they are fixed.                                       Software  configuration   management tools support  each of the above activities.                                   These tools may be designed to work together in a comprehensive change management                                   system, such as ClearCase (Bellagio and Milligan, 2005). In integrated configuration                                   management systems, version management, system integration, and problem-tracking                                   tools are designed together. They share a user interface style and are integrated through                                   a common code repository.                                       Alternatively,   separate tools, installed in an integrated development environment,                                   may be used. Version management may be supported using a version  management                                   system such as Subversion (Pilato et al., 2008), which can support multi-site,  multi-                                   team development. System integration support may be built into the language or rely                                   on a separate toolset such as the GNU build  system. This includes  what is perhaps                                   the best-known integration tool,  Unix make. Bug tracking  or issue tracking systems,                                   such as Bugzilla,   are used  to report  bugs  and other  issues and to  keep track  of                                   whether or not these have been fixed.                                       Because of its  importance in professional software  engineering, I discuss change                                   and configuration management in more detail in  Chapter 25.                     7.3.3 Host-target           development                                   Most software development is based on a host-target model. Software is developed on                                   one computer (the host), but runs on a separate machine (the target). More generally,                                   we can talk about a development platform  and an execution platform. A  platform  is                                   more than just hardware. It includes the installed operating system plus other support-                                   ing software such as a database management system or, for development platforms,                                   an interactive development environment.                                       Sometimes, the development and execution platforms are the same, making it possi-                                   ble to develop the software and test it on the same machine. More commonly, however,                                   they are different so that you need to either move your developed software to the execu-                                   tion platform for testing or run a simulator on your development machine.                                       Simulators are often used when developing embedded systems. You simulate hard-                                   ware devices, such as sensors, and the events in the environment in which the system                                   will  be deployed. Simulators speed up the development process for embedded systems                                   as each developer can have their own execution platform with no need to download the                                   software to the target hardware. However, simulators are expensive to develop and so                                   are only usually available for the most popular hardware architectures.                                       If  the  target system has installed middleware  or other software  that you need to                                   use, then you need to be able to test the system using that software. It may be imprac-                                   tical to  install that software  on your development machine,  even if it  is the same as                                   the target platform, because of license restrictions. In those circumstances, you need                                   to transfer your developed code to the execution platform to test the system.214                                                                                                  7.3 \\x02 Implementation      issues 197              UML deployment diagramsUML deployment diagrams show how software components are physically deployed on processors; thatis, the deployment diagram shows the hardware and software in the system and the middleware usedto connect the different components in the system. Essentially, you can think of deployment diagrams asa way of defining and documenting the target environment.                             http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Deployment/                              A software development platform  should provide a range of tools to support soft-                         ware engineering processes. These may include:                         1. An     integrated compiler  and syntax-directed  editing  system that  allows you  to                                create, edit, and compile code.                         2. A     language debugging system.                         3. Graphical    editing  tools, such as tools to edit UML  models.                         4. Testing    tools,  such as JUnit (Massol, 2003)  that can automatically  run a set of                                tests on a new version of a program.                         5. Project    support tools  that help you organize the code for  different development                                projects.                         As well  as these standard tools, your development system may include more special-                         ized tools such as static analyzers (discussed in Chapter 15). Normally, development                         environments  for  teams also include  a shared server that  runs a change and con-                         figuration   management  system and,  perhaps, a  system to  support  requirements                         management.                              Software development  tools are often  grouped to  create an integrated develop-                         ment environment  (IDE).  An  IDE  is a set of  software tools  that supports different                         aspects of software development,  within  some common framework  and user inter-                         face. Generally, IDEs are created to support development in a specific programming                         language such as Java. The language IDE may be developed specially, or may be an                         instantiation of  a general-purpose IDE, with specific  language-support tools.                              A general-purpose IDE is a framework for hosting software tools that provides data                         management facilities for the software being developed, and integration mechanisms,                         that allow tools to  work together. The best-known general-purpose IDE is the Eclipse                         environment (Carlson, 2005). This environment is  based on a plug-in architecture so                         that it can be specialized for different languages and application domains (Clayberg and                         Rubel, 2006). Therefore, you can install Eclipse and tailor it for your specific needs by                         adding plug-ins. For example, you may add a set of plug-ins to support networked sys-                         tems development in Java or embedded systems engineering using C.                              As part of  the development process, you need to  make decisions about how the                         developed software will  be deployed on  the target platform. This  is straightforward215198 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                   for embedded systems, where the target is usually  a single computer. However,  for                                   distributed systems, you need to decide on the specific platforms  where the compo-                                   nents will  be deployed. Issues that you have to consider in making this decision are:                                   1. The    hardware  and  software requirements  of  a component If   a component  is                                          designed for a specific  hardware architecture, or relies  on some other software                                          system, it must obviously  be deployed on a platform  that provides the required                                          hardware and software support.                                   2. The    availability    requirements   of the  system High-availability     systems may                                          require components to be deployed on more than one platform. This means that,                                          in the event of platform  failure, an alternative implementation  of the component                                          is available.                                   3. Component    communications If   there is a high  level of  communications  traffic                                          between components, it usually  makes sense to deploy them on the same plat-                                          form  or  on  platforms   that  are physically    close to  one  other.  This  reduces                                          communications  latency, the delay between the time  a message is sent by one                                          component and received by another.                                   You can document your decisions on hardware and software deployment using UML                                   deployment diagrams, which  show how software components are distributed across                                   hardware platforms.                                       If  you  are developing  an embedded system, you may have to  take into  account                                   target characteristics, such as its physical size, power capabilities, the need for real-                                   time responses to sensor events, the physical characteristics of actuators, and its real-                                   time operating system. I discuss embedded systems engineering in Chapter 20.                       7.4 Open            source         development                                   Open source development  is  an approach  to software  development  in  which  the                                   source code of a software system is published  and volunteers are invited to  partici-                                   pate in the development process (Raymond, 2001). Its roots are in the Free Software                                   Foundation  (http://www.fsf.org),   which   advocates that source code should  not be                                   proprietary but rather should always be available for users to examine and modify as                                   they wish.  There was an assumption that  the code would  be controlled  and devel-                                   oped by a small core group, rather than users of the code.                                       Open  source software extended this idea by using  the Internet to recruit  a much                                   larger population of  volunteer developers. Many  of them are also users of the code.                                   In principle   at least, any contributor  to  an open source project  may report  and fix                                   bugs and propose new features and functionality.   However, in  practice, successful                                   open source systems still rely on a core group of developers who control  changes to                                   the software.216                                                                   7.4 \\x02 Open    source development 199    The  best-known open source product  is, of  course, the Linux   operating systemwhich is widely  used as a server system and, increasingly, as a desktop environment.Other important   open source products  are Java, the  Apache web  server, and  themySQL database management system. Major players in the computer industry suchas IBM and Sun support the open source movement and base their software on opensource products. There are thousands of  other, lesser known  open source systemsand components that may also be used.    It  is usually  fairly   cheap or free to  acquire open source software.  You can nor-mally download  open source software without  charge. However, if  you want  docu-mentation and support, then you may have to pay for this, but costs are usually fairlylow. The other key benefit of  using open source products is that mature open sourcesystems are usually very reliable. The reason for this is  that they have a large popu-lation of  users who are willing   to fix  problems  themselves rather than report theseproblems to the developer and wait for a new release of the system. Bugs are discov-ered and repaired more quickly than is usually possible with  proprietary software.    For  a company  involved  in  software  development,  there are  two open  sourceissues that have to be considered:1. Should   the product that is being developed make use of open source components?2. Should    an open source approach be used for the software’s development?    The answers to these questions depend on the type of software that is being devel-oped and the background and experience of the development team.    If  you are developing a software product for sale, then time to market and reducedcosts are critical. If  you are developing in  a domain in  which there are high-qualityopen source systems available, you can save time and money by using these systems.However, if  you are developing software to  a specific set of organizational  require-ments, then using open source components may not be an option. You may  have tointegrate your  software with  existing  systems that are incompatible  with  availableopen source systems. Even then, however, it could be quicker and cheaper to modifythe open source system rather than redevelop the functionality that you need.    More  and more product companies are using an open source approach to develop-ment. Their business model is not reliant on selling  a software product but rather onselling support for that product. They believe that involving  the open source commu-nity will  allow  software to be developed more cheaply, more quickly, and will createa community of users for the software. Again, however, this is really  only applicablefor general software products rather than specific organizational applications.    Many  companies believe that adopting an open source approach will reveal confi-dential business knowledge  to their  competitors  and so are reluctant  to adopt  thisdevelopment model. However, if you  are working in  a small company and you opensource your software, this may  reassure customers that they will  be able to supportthe software if your company goes out of business.    Publishing  the source code of a system does not mean that people from the widercommunity will   necessarily help with its development. Most  successful open source217200 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation                                   products have been platform  products rather than  application systems. There are a                                   limited  number of developers who might be interested in specialized application sys-                                   tems. As such, making  a software system open source does not guarantee commu-                                   nity involvement.                     7.4.1 Open        source    licensing                                   Although  a fundamental  principle  of open-source development is  that source code                                   should be freely available,  this does not mean that anyone can do as they wish with                                   that code. Legally, the developer of the code (either a company or an individual) still                                   owns the code. They  can place restrictions  on  how it  is used by  including  legally                                   binding  conditions  in  an open source software  license  (St. Laurent,  2004).  Some                                   open source developers believe that if an open source component is used to develop                                   a new system, then  that system should  also be open source. Others  are willing   to                                   allow their  code to be used without  this restriction.  The developed systems may be                                   proprietary and sold as closed source systems.                                        Most open source licenses are derived from one of three general models:                                   1. The    GNU General Public  License (GPL). This is a so-called ‘reciprocal’  license                                          that, simplistically,   means that if you  use open source software that is licensed                                          under the GPL license, then you must make that software open source.                                   2. The    GNU  Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  This  is a variant of  the GPL                                          license where you can write  components that link  to open source code without                                          having to  publish the source of  these components. However, if you  change the                                          licensed component, then you must publish this as open source.                                   3. The    Berkley   Standard Distribution    (BSD)  License.  This  is a non-reciprocal                                          license, which means you are not obliged to republish any changes or modifica-                                          tions made to open source code. You can include the code in proprietary systems                                          that are sold.  If  you use open source components, you  must acknowledge  the                                          original  creator of the code.                                        Licensing issues are important because if you use open-source software as part of                                   a software product, then you may be obliged by the terms of the license to make your                                   own product  open source. If you  are trying  to sell  your software,  you may wish  to                                   keep it  secret. This  means that you  may wish  to  avoid  using GPL-licensed  open                                   source software in its development.                                        If you are building  software that runs on an open source platform, such as Linux,                                   then licenses are not a problem. However, as soon as you start including open source                                   components in  your software  you  need to set up processes and databases to keep                                   track of what’s been used and their license conditions. Bayersdorfer (2007) suggests                                   that companies managing projects that use open source should:                                   1. Establish    a system for  maintaining information   about open source components                                          that are downloaded and used. You have to keep a copy of  the license for each218                                                                                                                    Chapter 7 \\x02 Key   points 201                                        component that  was valid at  the time  the component was used. Licenses may                                        change so you need to know the conditions that you have agreed to.                                 2. Be    aware of the different  types of licenses and understand how a component is                                        licensed before it is used. You may decide to use a component in one system but                                        not in another because you plan to use these systems in different ways.                                 3. Be    aware of evolution  pathways for components. You need to know a bit  about                                        the open source project  where  components are developed  to understand how                                        they might change in future.                                 4. Educate    people about open source. It’s not enough to  have procedures in place                                        to ensure compliance with license conditions. You also need to educate develop-                                        ers about open source and open source licensing.                                 5. Have    auditing  systems in  place.  Developers, under  tight  deadlines, might  be                                        tempted to break the terms of a license. If possible, you should have software in                                        place to detect and stop this.                                 6. Participate    in the open source community.  If you  rely on open source products,                                        you should participate in  the community and help support their  development.                                     The business model of software  is changing. It is becoming increasingly  difficult                                 to build a business by selling  specialized software systems. Many companies prefer                                 to make their software open source and then sell support and consultancy to software                                 users. This trend is likely  to accelerate, with increasing use of open source software                                 and with more and more software available in this  form.KEY     POINTS     \\x02 Software   design and implementation  are interleaved activities. The level of detail in the design           depends on the type of system being developed and whether you are using a plan-driven or           agile approach.     \\x02 The   process of object-oriented design includes activities  to design the system architecture,           identify objects  in the system, describe the design using different object models, and document           the component interfaces.     \\x02 A   range of different models may be produced during an object-oriented  design process. These           include static models (class models, generalization models, association  models) and dynamic           models (sequence models, state machine models).     \\x02 Component   interfaces must be defined precisely so that other objects  can use them. A UML           interface stereotype may be used to define interfaces.     \\x02 When   developing software, you should always consider the possibility  of reusing existing           software, either as components, services, or complete systems.219202 Chapter    7 \\x02 Design    and implementation       \\x02 Configuration   management is the process of managing changes to an evolving software system.             It is essential when a team of people are cooperating to develop software.       \\x02 Most   software  development is host-target development. You use an IDE on a host machine to             develop the software, which is transferred  to a target machine for execution.       \\x02 Open   source development involves making the source code of a system publicly available. This             means that many people can propose changes and improvements to the software.FURTHER      READING       Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Software.

Using the weather station  objects identified  in Figure 7.6 as a starting point, identify further                objects that  may be used in this system. Design an inheritance hierarchy for the objects that                you have identified.         7.5. Develop the design of the weather station  to show the interaction between the data collection                subsystem and the instruments  that collect weather data. Use sequence diagrams to show                this  interaction.         7.6. Identify possible objects in the following systems and develop an object-oriented design for                them. You may make any reasonable assumptions about the systems when deriving the design.                \\x02 A  group diary and time management system is intended to support  the timetabling  of                     meetings and appointments across a group of co-workers. When an appointment is to be                     made that involves a number of people, the system finds a common slot in each of their                     diaries and arranges the appointment for  that time. If no common slots are available, it                     interacts with  the user to rearrange his or her personal diary to make room for the                     appointment.                \\x02 A  filling  station (gas station) is to be set up for fully  automated operation. Drivers                      swipe their credit  card through a reader connected to the pump; the card is verified by                     communication with  a credit company computer, and a fuel limit is established. The driver                     may then take the fuel required. When fuel delivery is complete and the pump hose is                     returned to its  holster, the driver’s credit card account is debited with the cost of the fuel                     taken. The credit card is returned after debiting. If the  card is invalid, the pump returns it                     before fuel is dispensed.         7.7. Draw a sequence diagram showing the interactions of objects in a group diary system when a                group of people are arranging a meeting.         7.8. Draw a UML state diagram showing the possible state changes in either the group diary or the                filling  station system.         7.9. Using examples, explain why configuration  management is important when a team of people                are developing a software product.       7.10. A small company has developed a specialized product that it configures specially for each                customer. New customers usually have specific requirements to be incorporated into their                system, and they pay for these to be developed. The company has an opportunity to bid for a new                contract, which would more than double its customer base. The new customer also wishes to                have some involvement in the configuration of the system. Explain why, in these circumstances, it                might be a good idea for the company owning the software to make it open source.REFERENCES       Abbott, R.

When you have read the chapter, you will:           \\x02 understand the stages of testing from testing, during development              to acceptance testing by system customers;           \\x02 have been introduced to techniques that help you choose test              cases that are geared to discovering program defects;           \\x02 understand test-first development, where you design tests before              writing code and run these tests automatically;           \\x02 know the important differences between component, system,              and release testing and be aware of user testing processes and              techniques.          Contents          8.1 Development testing          8.2 Test-driven development          8.3 Release testing          8.4 User testing223206 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                   Testing is intended to show that a program does what it is intended to do and to dis-                                   cover program defects before it is put into  use. When you test software, you execute                                   a program using artificial  data. You check the results of the test run for errors, anom-                                   alies, or information  about the program’s non-functional  attributes.                                       The  testing process has two distinct goals:                                   1. To    demonstrate to  the developer and the  customer that the software  meets its                                          requirements. For custom software, this  means that there should be at least one                                          test for  every requirement in  the requirements document. For generic software                                          products, it  means that there should be tests for all of  the system features, plus                                          combinations of  these features, that will be incorporated in the product release.                                   2. To    discover situations in  which  the behavior of the software  is incorrect, unde-                                          sirable,  or does not  conform  to its  specification.  These are a consequence of                                          software defects. Defect  testing is concerned with  rooting  out undesirable sys-                                          tem behavior such as system crashes, unwanted interactions with other systems,                                          incorrect computations, and data corruption.                                       The  first goal leads to validation  testing, where you expect the system to perform                                   correctly  using a given set of  test cases that reflect the system’s expected use. The                                   second goal  leads to defect  testing,  where  the test cases are designed  to expose                                   defects. The test  cases in defect testing  can be deliberately  obscure and  need not                                   reflect  how the system is  normally  used. Of  course, there is  no definite  boundary                                   between these two  approaches to testing. During   validation  testing,  you will   find                                   defects in the system; during defect testing, some of the tests will  show that the pro-                                   gram meets its requirements.                                       The  diagram shown  in Figure  8.1 may  help to  explain  the differences between                                   validation  testing  and defect testing.  Think  of  the system  being tested as a black                                   box. The  system accepts inputs from  some input  set I and generates outputs in  an                                   output set O. Some of the outputs will  be erroneous. These are the outputs in set Oe                                   that are generated by the system in  response to inputs in  the set Ie. The priority  in                                   defect testing is to find  those inputs in the set Ie because these reveal problems with                                   the system. Validation testing involves testing  with correct inputs  that are outside Ie.                                   These stimulate the system to generate the expected correct outputs.                                       Testing  cannot  demonstrate that  the software  is  free  of defects  or that  it  will                                   behave as specified in every circumstance. It  is always possible that  a test that you                                   have overlooked   could  discover   further  problems   with  the  system.  As  Edsger                                   Dijkstra, an early contributor  to the development of software engineering, eloquently                                   stated (Dijkstra et al., 1972):                                       Testing can only show the presence of errors, not their absence                                       Testing is part of a broader process of software verification and validation (V & V).                                   Verification and validation  are not the same thing, although they are often confused.224                                                                                                            Chapter 8 \\x02 Software    testing 207                                                      Input Test Data              Ie                              Inputs Causing                                                                                                                              Anomalous                                                                                                                              Behavior                                                                             SystemFigure 8.1 An                                Output Test Results       Oe                             Outputs Which Revealinput-output model                                                                                                the Presence ofof program testing                                                                                                 Defects                                   Barry Boehm, a pioneer of  software engineering, succinctly expressed the difference                                   between them (Boehm, 1979):                                   \\x02 ‘Validation:   Are we  building the right  product?’                                   \\x02 ‘Verification:   Are  we building  the product right?’                                       Verification   and validation  processes are concerned with checking that software                                   being developed meets its specification and delivers the functionality expected by the                                   people paying for the software. These checking processes start as soon as requirements                                   become available and continue through all stages of the development process.                                       The aim of  verification is to check that the software meets its stated functional and                                   non-functional requirements. Validation, however, is a more general process. The aim                                   of validation  is to ensure that the software meets the customer’s expectations. It goes                                   beyond simply checking conformance with the specification to demonstrating that the                                   software does what the customer expects it to do. Validation  is essential because, as                                    I discussed in Chapter 4,  requirements specifications do  not always reflect  the real                                   wishes or needs of system customers and users.                                       The  ultimate  goal of  verification  and  validation  processes is to establish confi-                                   dence that the software system is ‘fit  for purpose’.  This means that the system must                                   be good enough for its intended use. The level of required confidence depends on the                                   system’s purpose, the expectations of  the system users, and the  current marketing                                   environment for the system:                                   1. Software    purpose The  more critical  the software,  the more important  that it  is                                          reliable. For example, the level of confidence  required for software used to con-                                          trol  a safety-critical   system is much  higher than that  required for  a prototype                                          that has been developed to demonstrate new product ideas.                                   2. User    expectations Because of their experiences with buggy, unreliable software,                                          many users have low  expectations of  software quality.  They  are not surprised                                          when their  software  fails.

However, as software matures, users expect it to become more reliable so                                          more thorough testing of  later versions may be required.                                   3. Marketing     environment When  a system is  marketed, the sellers  of the system                                          must take into account competing products, the price that customers are willing                                          to pay  for a system, and the required  schedule for delivering  that  system. In a                                          competitive environment,  a software company may decide to release a program                                          before it  has been fully  tested and debugged because they want to be the  first                                          into the market. If  a software product is very cheap, users may be willing to tol-                                          erate a lower level of reliability.                                       As  well  as software testing,  the verification  and validation  process may involve                                   software inspections  and reviews.  Inspections and  reviews analyze and  check the                                   system requirements, design models, the program  source code, and even proposed                                   system tests. These are so-called ‘static’ V &  V techniques in which  you don’t  need                                   to execute the software to  verify  it. Figure  8.2 shows that software inspections  and                                   testing support V & V  at different stages in the software process. The arrows indicate                                   the stages in the process where the techniques may be used.                                       Inspections  mostly focus on  the source code of a system but any readable repre-                                   sentation  of  the  software,  such  as its  requirements  or  a  design  model,  can  be                                   inspected. When you inspect a system, you use knowledge of the system, its applica-                                   tion domain, and the programming  or modeling language to discover errors.                                       There are three advantages of software inspection over testing:                                   1. During     testing,  errors  can mask  (hide)  other  errors. When  an error  leads to                                          unexpected outputs, you can never be sure if  later output  anomalies are due to                                          a new  error or  are side  effects of  the original   error.  Because inspection  is a                                          static  process,  you  don’t  have  to  be concerned  with   interactions   between                                          errors. Consequently, a single inspection  session can discover many errors in a                                          system.226                                                                                                       Chapter 8 \\x02 Software    testing 209              Test planningTest planning is concerned with scheduling and resourcing all of the activities in the testing process. It involvesdefining the testing process, taking into account the people and the time available. Usually, a test plan will becreated, which defines what is to be tested, the predicted testing schedule, and how tests will be recorded. Forcritical systems, the test plan may also include details of the tests to be run on the software.                            http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Testing/Planning.html                              2. Incomplete     versions of  a system can be inspected without  additional   costs. If                                     a program is  incomplete,  then you need to  develop specialized  test harnesses                                     to test the parts that are available.  This obviously   adds to the system develop-                                     ment costs.                              3. As     well  as searching  for  program   defects, an  inspection  can  also consider                                     broader quality   attributes  of  a program,  such as compliance  with  standards,                                     portability,  and  maintainability.  You  can look  for inefficiencies,   inappropriate                                     algorithms, and poor programming  style that could make the system difficult   to                                     maintain and update.                                  Program  inspections   are an old  idea and  there have been several  studies and                              experiments that  have demonstrated that inspections  are more effective  for  defect                              discovery than  program testing.  Fagan (1986) reported that  more than 60%  of the                              errors in  a program  can  be detected using  informal   program  inspections.  In  the                              Cleanroom process (Prowell et al., 1999), it is claimed that more than 90% of defects                              can be discovered in program inspections.                                  However,  inspections  cannot replace software testing.  Inspections are not good                              for discovering  defects  that arise because of unexpected interactions  between dif-                              ferent  parts  of  a program,   timing   problems,   or problems   with  system  perfor-                              mance. Furthermore,  especially in  small companies or  development groups, it  can                              be difficult   and expensive to put  together a separate inspection  team as all poten-                              tial  members of the  team may also be software  developers.  I discuss reviews  and                              inspections in  more detail  in Chapter 24 (Quality   Management). Automated  static                              analysis, where the source text  of a program is automatically   analyzed to discover                              anomalies,  is  explained   in Chapter   15. In  this  chapter,  I  focus  on  testing  and                              testing processes.                                  Figure  8.3 is an abstract model of the ‘traditional’ testing process, as used in plan-                              driven development.  Test cases are specifications of  the inputs  to  the test and the                              expected output from the system (the test results), plus a statement of what is  being                              tested. Test data are the inputs that have been devised to test a system. Test data can                              sometimes be generated automatically, but automatic test case generation is impossi-                              ble, as people who understand what the system is supposed to do must be involved to                              specify  the expected test results.  However,  test execution  can be automated. The                              expected results are automatically compared with the predicted results so there is no                              need for a person to look for errors and anomalies in the test run.227210 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                   Test                                 Test                                 Test                                 Test                                  Cases                               Data                              Results                           Reports          Design Test                    Prepare Test                   Run Program               Compare Results              Cases                               Data                         with Test Data                  to Test Cases                                       Typically,  a commercial software system has to go through three stages of testing:Figure 8.3 A modelof the software testingprocess                      1. Development    testing, where the system is tested during development to discover                                          bugs and defects. System designers and programmers are likely to  be involved                                          in the testing process.                                   2. Release    testing, where a separate testing team tests a complete  version of  the                                          system before it is  released to users. The aim of release testing is to check that                                          the system meets the requirements of system stakeholders.                                   3. User    testing, where users or potential  users of a system test the system in their                                          own environment.  For software products, the ‘user’  may be an internal market-                                          ing  group  who  decide if   the software  can  be marketed,  released, and  sold.                                          Acceptance testing is one type of user testing where the customer formally tests                                          a system to decide if it should be accepted from the system supplier or if further                                          development is required.                                       In  practice,  the testing process usually  involves  a mixture  of  manual and auto-                                   mated testing. In manual  testing, a tester runs the program with  some test data and                                   compares the results to their expectations. They note and report discrepancies to the                                   program developers. In automated testing, the tests are encoded in a program that is                                   run each time  the system under development  is to be tested. This  is usually  faster                                   than manual testing, especially when it  involves regression testing—re-running  pre-                                   vious tests to check that changes to the program have not introduced new bugs.                                       The  use of automated testing has increased considerably over the past few years.                                   However, testing  can never be completely  automated  as automated tests can only                                   check that a program does what it is supposed to do. It is practically impossible to use                                   automated testing to test systems that depend on how things  look (e.g.,  a graphical                                   user interface), or to test that a program does not have unwanted side effects.                       8.1 Development                     testing                                   Development testing  includes all  testing activities  that  are carried out by  the team                                   developing the  system. The tester of  the software  is usually  the programmer  who                                   developed that software,  although  this is  not always  the case. Some development                                   processes use programmer/tester  pairs  (Cusamano and Selby,  1998)  where each228                                                                                                          8.1 \\x02 Development     testing 211              DebuggingDebugging is the process of fixing errors and problems that have been discovered by testing. Using informationfrom the program tests, debuggers use their knowledge of the programming language and the intendedoutcome of the test to locate and repair the program error. This process is often supported by interactivedebugging tools that provide extra information about program execution.                           http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Testing/Debugging.html                              programmer has an associated tester who develops tests and assists with the testing                              process. For critical  systems, a more  formal  process may be used, with  a separate                              testing group within  the development team. They are responsible for developing tests                              and maintaining detailed records of  test results.                                   During development, testing may be carried out at three levels of granularity:                              1. Unit     testing,  where individual  program  units or  object classes are tested. Unit                                     testing should focus on testing the functionality   of objects or methods.                              2. Component    testing, where several individual  units are integrated to create com-                                     posite  components.  Component  testing  should  focus  on  testing  component                                     interfaces.                              3. System    testing, where some or all of  the components in a system are integrated                                     and the system is tested as a whole. System testing should focus on testing com-                                     ponent interactions.                                   Development testing is primarily a defect testing process, where the aim of testing                              is to discover bugs in the software. It is therefore usually interleaved with debugging—                              the process of locating problems with the code and changing the program to fix these                              problems.                 8.1.1 Unit       testing                              Unit  testing is the process of testing program components, such as methods or object                              classes. Individual  functions  or methods are the simplest  type of  component. Your                              tests should be calls to  these routines with  different  input parameters. You can use                              the approaches to test case design discussed in Section 8.1.2, to design the function                              or method tests.                                   When you are testing object classes, you should design your tests to provide cov-                              erage of all of the features of the object. This  means that you should:                              \\x7f test   all  operations associated with the object;                              \\x7f set   and check the value of all attributes associated with the object;                              \\x7f put    the object  into  all  possible states. This  means that you should  simulate  all                                   events that cause a state change.229212 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                                                                         WeatherStation                                                                                 identifier                                                                                 reportWeather ( )                                                                                 reportStatus ( )                                                                                 powerSave (instruments)                                                                                 remoteControl (commands)                                                                                 reconfigure (commands)                                                                                 restart (instruments)Figure 8.4 The weather                                            shutdown (instruments)station object interface                                       Consider, for example, the weather station object from the example that I discussed                                   in Chapter 7. The interface of this object is shown in Figure 8.4. It has a single attribute,                                   which is its identifier. This is a constant that is set when the weather station is installed.                                   You therefore only need a test that checks if it has been properly set up. You need to                                   define test cases for all of the methods associated with the object such as reportWeather,                                   reportStatus, etc. Ideally, you should test methods in isolation but, in some cases, some                                   test sequences are necessary. For example, to test the method that  shuts down the                                   weather station instruments (shutdown), you need to have executed the restart method.                                       Generalization  or inheritance  makes object class testing more  complicated. You                                   can’t simply  test an operation in the class where it is defined and assume that it will                                   work  as expected in the subclasses that inherit the operation.  The operation that  is                                   inherited may  make assumptions about other operations and  attributes. These may                                   not be valid in  some subclasses that inherit the operation. You therefore have to test                                   the inherited operation in all  of the contexts where it is used.                                       To  test the states of the weather  station, you use a state model,  such as the one                                   shown in  Figure  7.8 in  the previous  chapter.  Using  this model,  you  can identify                                   sequences of state transitions that have to  be tested and define event sequences to                                   force these transitions.  In principle,   you should  test every possible state transition                                   sequence, although   in  practice  this   may  be too  expensive.   Examples  of  state                                   sequences that should be tested in the weather station include:                                       Shutdown → Running → Shutdown                                       Configuring → Running →Testing  →Transmitting  → Running                                       Running → Collecting → Running → Summarizing →Transmitting  → Running                                       Whenever  possible, you should automate unit  testing. In  automated unit testing,                                   you make use of a test automation framework  (such as JUnit) to write  and run your                                   program tests. Unit  testing frameworks provide  generic test classes that you extend                                   to create specific test cases. They can then run all  of the tests that you  have imple-                                   mented and report, often through some GUI, on the success or failure of the tests. An                                   entire test suite can often be run in  a few seconds so it is possible to execute all the                                   tests every time you make a change to the program.                                       An  automated test has three parts:                                   1. A     setup part,  where you  initialize   the system  with  the test  case, namely the                                          inputs and expected outputs.230                                                                                          8.1 \\x02 Development     testing 213             2. A     call part, where you  call the object or method to be tested.             3. An     assertion  part where you  compare the result  of  the call  with  the expected                     result. If  the assertion  evaluates to true, the test  has been successful; if  false,                     then it has failed.                  Sometimes the object that you  are testing has dependencies on other objects that             may  not have been written or which  slow down  the testing process if they are used.             For  example, if  your object  calls a database, this may involve a slow  setup process             before  it  can be used. In these cases, you may  decide to use mock  objects. Mock             objects  are objects with  the same interface  as the external objects  being used that             simulate  its functionality.  Therefore, a mock  object simulating  a database may have             only  a few data items that are organized in an array. They can therefore be accessed             quickly,  without  the overheads of calling  a database and accessing disks. Similarly,             mock  objects can be used to simulate abnormal operation or rare events. For exam-             ple,  if  your  system is  intended to  take action  at certain  times  of  day, your  mock             object  can simply return those times, irrespective of the actual clock  time.8.1.2 Choosing         unit    test   cases             Testing is expensive and time consuming, so it is important that you choose effective             unit  test cases. Effectiveness, in this case, means two things:             1. The    test cases should show that, when used as expected, the component that you                     are testing does what it is supposed to do.             2. If     there are defects in the component, these should be revealed by test cases.                  You should therefore write  two kinds of  test case. The first of these should reflect             normal  operation  of  a program  and should  show  that the  component works.  For             example,  if  you are testing  a component  that creates and initializes  a  new patient             record,  then your test case should show that the record exists in a database and that             its  fields have been set as specified. The other kind  of test case should be based on             testing  experience of where common problems  arise. It should use abnormal inputs             to check that these are properly processed and do not crash the component.                  I  discuss two possible strategies here that can be effective in helping you  choose             test cases. These are:             1. Partition     testing, where you identify  groups of inputs that have common charac-                     teristics and should be processed in the same way. You should choose tests from                     within  each of these groups.             2. Guideline-based     testing, where you  use testing guidelines to choose test cases.                     These guidelines reflect previous experience of the kinds of errors that program-                     mers often make when developing components.231214 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                                  Input Equivalence Partitions                                   Output Partitions                                                                                                       System                                                                                                             Correct                                                                                                           OutputsFigure 8.5 Equivalencepartitioning                                            Possible Inputs                                          Possible Outputs                                        The input data and output results of a program  often fall  into a number of differ-                                   ent classes with  common  characteristics.   Examples of  these classes are positive                                   numbers, negative numbers, and  menu selections. Programs normally   behave in a                                   comparable way for all  members of a class. That is, if you test a program that does a                                   computation and requires two positive numbers, then you would  expect the program                                   to behave in the same way for all positive numbers.                                        Because of this equivalent  behavior, these classes are sometimes called equiva-                                   lence partitions  or  domains  (Bezier, 1990).  One systematic  approach to  test case                                   design is based on identifying all  input and output partitions  for a system or compo-                                   nent. Test cases are designed so that the inputs or outputs lie within these partitions.                                   Partition testing can be used to design test cases for both systems and components.                                        In Figure 8.5, the large shaded ellipse on the left represents the set of all possible                                   inputs to  the program that  is being tested. The smaller  unshaded ellipses represent                                   equivalence partitions. A program  being tested should process all of the members of                                   an input  equivalence partitions  in the same way.  Output equivalence partitions  are                                   partitions  within  which  all  of  the outputs have something  in common.  Sometimes                                   there is a 1:1  mapping between  input and output  equivalence partitions.  However,                                   this is not always the case; you may need to define a separate input equivalence par-                                   tition,  where the only common  characteristic of the inputs  is that they generate out-                                   puts within  the same output partition.  The shaded area in the left  ellipse represents                                   inputs that are invalid. The shaded area in the right ellipse represents exceptions that                                   may occur (i.e., responses to invalid inputs).                                        Once you have identified  a set of partitions,  you  choose test cases from each of                                   these partitions. A  good rule of  thumb for  test case selection is to choose test cases                                   on the boundaries of the partitions,  plus cases close to the midpoint of the partition.                                   The reason for this is that designers and programmers tend to consider typical values                                   of inputs when  developing a system. You test these by choosing the midpoint of the                                   partition.  Boundary values are often atypical (e.g., zero may behave differently from                                   other non-negative numbers) so are sometimes overlooked  by developers. Program                                   failures often occur when  processing these atypical values.232                                                                                                               8.1 \\x02 Development     testing 215                                                                                  3                                    11                                                                                    4               7              10                                                              Less than 4        Between 4 and 10       More than 10                                                        Number of Input Values                                                                          9999                                       100000                                                                                10000       50000        99999                                                    Less than 10000    Between 10000 and 99999 More than 99999Figure 8.6 Equivalencepartitions                                 Input Values                                        You identify  partitions by using  the program specification or user documentation                                   and from  experience where you predict  the classes of input value  that are likely  to                                   detect errors.  For  example,  say a program  specification   states that  the program                                   accepts 4 to 8 inputs which  are five-digit  integers greater than 10,000. You use this                                   information  to identify  the input  partitions and possible test input  values. These are                                   shown in Figure 8.6.                                        When you use the specification of a system to identify equivalence partitions, this                                   is called ‘black-box  testing’. Here, you don’t  need any knowledge of how the system                                   works. However,  it may  be helpful  to supplement  the black-box  tests with  ‘white-                                   box testing’,  where you look  at the code of the program to find  other possible tests.                                   For example, your code may include  exceptions to handle incorrect inputs.  You can                                   use this knowledge  to  identify  ‘exception   partitions’—different    ranges where the                                   same exception handling should be applied.                                        Equivalence  partitioning   is  an effective   approach to  testing  because it  helps                                   account for errors that programmers often make when processing inputs at the edges                                   of  partitions.   You   can also   use testing   guidelines   to  help  choose  test  cases.                                   Guidelines encapsulate knowledge of  what kinds  of test cases are effective for dis-                                   covering errors. For example, when you are testing programs with sequences, arrays,                                   or lists, guidelines that could  help reveal defects include:                                   1. Test    software with  sequences that have only a single value. Programmers natu-                                          rally  think of sequences as made up of several values and sometimes they embed                                          this  assumption in  their  programs.  Consequently, if  presented with   a single-                                          value sequence, a program may not work properly.                                   2. Use    different  sequences of different  sizes in different  tests. This decreases the                                          chances that a program with  defects will  accidentally  produce a correct output                                          because of some accidental characteristics of the input.                                   3. Derive     tests so that  the  first,  middle,  and  last elements  of  the sequence are                                          accessed. This approach is reveals problems at partition boundaries.233216 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                   Path testing     Path testing is a testing strategy that aims to exercise every independent execution path through a component     or program. If every independent path is executed, then all statements in the component must have been     executed at least once. All conditional statements are tested for both true and false cases. In an object-oriented     development process, path testing may be used when testing the methods associated with objects.                                 http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Testing/PathTest.html                                       Whittaker’s  book  (2002) includes many  examples of guidelines that can be used                                   in test case design. Some of the most general guidelines that he suggests are:                                   \\x02 Choose inputs  that force the system to generate all error messages;                                   \\x02 Design  inputs that cause input buffers to overflow;                                   \\x02 Repeat the same input or series of inputs numerous times;                                   \\x02 Force  invalid outputs to be generated;                                   \\x02 Force  computation results to be too large or too small.                                       As  you gain experience with  testing, you can develop your own guidelines  about                                   how to choose effective test cases. I give more examples of testing guidelines in  the                                   next section of this chapter.                     8.1.3 Component          testing                                   Software components are often  composite components that are made up of  several                                   interacting objects.  For example, in the  weather station system, the reconfiguration                                   component includes objects  that deal with  each aspect of the  reconfiguration.  You                                   access the functionality  of  these objects through  the defined component  interface.                                   Testing composite components should therefore  focus on showing  that the compo-                                   nent interface behaves according to its specification.  You can assume that unit tests                                   on the individual  objects within  the component have been completed.                                       Figure  8.7 illustrates the idea of component interface testing. Assume that compo-                                   nents A, B,  and C have been integrated to create a larger component or subsystem.                                   The test cases are not applied to the individual components but rather to the interface                                   of the composite component created by combining these components. Interface errors                                   in the composite component may  not be detectable by testing the individual  objects                                   because these errors result from interactions between the objects in the component.                                       There  are different  types of interface  between program components and, conse-                                   quently, different types of  interface error that can occur:                                   1. Parameter    interfaces These are interfaces in which  data or sometimes function                                          references are passed from  one component  to another.  Methods in  an object                                          have a parameter interface.234                                                                                                               8.1 \\x02 Development     testing 217                                                                                              Test Cases                                                                                     A                             B                                                                                                     CFigure 8.7 Interfacetesting                                   2. Shared    memory interfaces These are interfaces in which  a block  of memory  is                                          shared between components. Data is placed  in the memory  by  one subsystem                                          and retrieved  from there  by other  sub-systems. This type  of interface  is often                                          used in  embedded  systems, where  sensors create data  that is  retrieved  and                                          processed by other system components.                                   3. Procedural     interfaces These  are interfaces in  which  one component encapsu-                                          lates a set of  procedures that can be called  by other components. Objects  and                                          reusable components have this form of interface.                                   4. Message    passing  interfaces These   are  interfaces  in  which   one component                                          requests a service from another component by passing a message to it. A return                                          message includes the results of executing the service. Some object-oriented sys-                                          tems have this form of interface,  as do client–server systems.                                        Interface errors are one of the most  common forms  of error in  complex systems                                   (Lutz, 1993).  These errors fall into three classes:                                   \\x02 Interface  misuse A calling  component calls some other component and makes an                                        error in the use of its interface. This type of error is common with parameter inter-                                        faces, where parameters may  be of  the wrong  type  or be passed in  the wrong                                        order, or the wrong number of parameters may be passed.                                   \\x02 Interface   misunderstanding A  calling  component misunderstands the  specifica-                                        tion of  the interface  of  the called component  and makes assumptions about  its                                        behavior. The called component does not behave as expected which then causes                                        unexpected behavior  in  the calling   component.  For example,  a binary  search                                        method may be  called with  a parameter that  is an unordered  array. The search                                        would then fail.                                   \\x02 Timing   errors These occur  in real-time  systems that  use a shared memory or  a                                        message-passing interface. The producer of data and the consumer of  data may235218 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                        operate at different speeds. Unless particular care is taken in the interface design,                                        the consumer can  access out-of-date  information   because the producer of  the                                        information  has not updated the shared interface information.                                        Testing for  interface defects is difficult   because some interface faults  may only                                   manifest themselves under  unusual conditions.  For example,  say an object imple-                                   ments a queue as a fixed-length data structure. A calling object may assume that the                                   queue is implemented as an infinite data structure and may not check for queue over-                                   flow  when an item is entered. This condition  can only be detected during testing by                                   designing test cases that force the queue to overflow and cause that overflow to cor-                                   rupt the object behavior in some detectable way.                                        A further  problem  may arise because of interactions  between faults in  different                                   modules or objects. Faults in one object may only be detected when some other object                                   behaves in an unexpected way. For  example, an object  may call  another object  to                                   receive some service and assume that the response is correct. If the called service is                                   faulty in some way, the returned value may be valid but incorrect. This is not immedi-                                   ately detected but only becomes obvious when some later computation goes wrong.                                        Some general guidelines for interface testing are:                                   1. Examine    the code to be tested and explicitly list  each call to an external compo-                                          nent. Design a set of tests in which  the values of the parameters to the external                                          components are at the extreme ends of  their ranges. These extreme values are                                          most likely  to reveal interface inconsistencies.                                   2. Where    pointers are passed across an interface, always test the interface with null                                          pointer parameters.                                   3. Where    a component  is called  through a procedural  interface, design  tests that                                          deliberately  cause the component to fail. Differing   failure  assumptions are one                                          of the most common specification  misunderstandings.                                   4. Use    stress testing  in  message passing systems.  This  means that you  should                                          design tests that generate many more messages than are likely to occur in prac-                                          tice. This is an effective  way of revealing timing  problems.                                   5. Where    several components  interact through  shared memory,  design tests that                                          vary the order in  which these components are activated. These tests may reveal                                          implicit   assumptions  made by the  programmer  about the  order in  which  the                                          shared data is produced and consumed.                                        Inspections and reviews  can sometimes be more  cost effective  than testing  for                                   discovering  interface errors.  Inspections can concentrate  on component interfaces                                   and questions  about the assumed interface  behavior  asked during  the  inspection                                   process. A strongly  typed language such as Java allows many interface errors to be                                   trapped by the compiler.  Static analyzers (see Chapter 15)  can detect a wide range                                   of interface errors.236                                                                                                           8.1 \\x02 Development    testing 219              Incremental integration and testingSystem testing involves integrating different components then testing the integrated system that you have created.You should always use an incremental approach to integration and testing (i.e., you should integrate a component,test the system, integrate another component, test again, and so on). This means that if problems occur, it is probablydue to interactions with the most recently integrated component.Incremental integration and testing is fundamental to agile methods such as XP, where regression tests (see Section8.2) are run every time a new increment is integrated.                           http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Testing/Integration.html                8.1.4 System         testing                              System testing during development involves  integrating components to create a ver-                              sion of  the system and then testing the integrated system. System testing checks that                              components are compatible, interact correctly  and transfer the right data at the right                              time  across their interfaces. It obviously  overlaps with  component testing  but there                              are two important  differences:                              1. During      system testing, reusable components that  have been separately devel-                                     oped and off-the-shelf systems may be integrated with newly developed compo-                                     nents. The complete system is then tested.                              2. Components    developed by different  team members or groups may be integrated                                     at this  stage. System testing is a collective rather than an individual  process. In                                     some companies,  system testing may  involve  a separate testing team with  no                                     involvement  from designers and programmers.                                   When you  integrate components to create a system, you get emergent behavior.                              This  means that some elements of system functionality  only become obvious when                              you  put the components  together. This may  be planned emergent behavior, which                              has to be tested. For example, you may integrate an authentication component with a                              component  that updates information.  You then  have a system feature that restricts                              information    updating  to  authorized   users.  Sometimes,  however,  the  emergent                              behavior  is unplanned and unwanted. You have to develop tests that check  that the                              system is only doing  what it is supposed to do.                                   Therefore  system testing  should focus  on testing  the interactions  between  the                              components and objects that make up a system. You may also test reusable compo-                              nents or systems to check that they work  as expected when they are integrated with                              new components. This interaction testing should discover those component bugs that                              are only  revealed when  a component is  used by other  components in  the system.                              Interaction  testing also helps find misunderstandings, made by component develop-                              ers, about other components in the system.                                   Because of  its  focus   on interactions,   use case–based testing   is an  effective                              approach to system testing. Typically, each use case is implemented by several com-                              ponents or  objects in  the system. Testing the  use case forces these interactions to237220 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                           Weather                   Information System                                                        SatComms          WeatherStation        Commslink            WeatherData                                    request (report)                                       acknowledge                                                                   reportWeather ( )                                                                      acknowledge                                                                                                   get (summary)        summarise ( )                                                                     send (Report)                                                                      acknowledge                                       reply (report)                                       acknowledge                                   occur. If you have developed a sequence diagram to model the use case implementa-Figure 8.8 Collectweather data              tion, you  can see the objects or components that are involved in the interaction.sequence chart               To illustrate  this,  I use an example  from  the wilderness weather  station system                                   where the weather station  is asked to report  summarized weather data to  a remote                                   computer. The  use case for this  is described in  Figure  7.3 (see previous chapter).                                   Figure 8.8 (which  is  a copy of Figure  7.7) shows the sequence of operations in  the                                   weather station when it responds to a request to collect data for the mapping system.                                   You can use this diagram to identify operations that will  be tested and to help design                                   the test cases to execute the tests. Therefore, issuing a request for a report will result                                   in the execution of the following   thread of methods:                                       SatComms:request →WeatherStation:reportWeather →Commslink:Get(summary)                                   →WeatherData:summarize                                       The  sequence diagram helps you design the specific test cases that you need as it                                   shows what inputs are required and what outputs are created:                                   1. An     input of  a request for a report  should have an associated acknowledgment.                                          A report  should  ultimately   be returned from  the  request. During  testing,  you                                          should  create summarized  data that  can  be used to  check that  the  report  is                                          correctly organized.                                   2. An     input request for  a report to WeatherStation results in  a summarized report                                          being  generated. You  can  test this  in  isolation   by  creating  raw  data corre-                                          sponding to the summary that  you have prepared for the test of SatComms and                                          checking that the WeatherStation object  correctly produces this  summary. This                                          raw data is also used to test the WeatherData object.238                                                                                  8.2 \\x02 Test-driven    development 221                 Of course, I have simplified the sequence diagram in Figure 8.8 so that it does not            show exceptions. A complete use case/scenario test must also take these into account            and ensure that objects correctly handle exceptions.                 For most systems, it is difficult  to know  how much system testing is essential and            when you  should to stop testing.  Exhaustive testing, where every possible program            execution sequence is tested, is impossible. Testing, therefore, has to be based on a            subset of possible  test cases. Ideally, software  companies should have policies  for            choosing this subset. These policies might be based on general testing policies, such            as  a  policy   that   all   program   statements  should   be  executed  at   least  once.            Alternatively,  they may be based on experience of system usage and focus on testing            the features of the operational system. For example:            1. All     system functions that are accessed through menus should be tested.            2. Combinations     of functions  (e.g., text formatting)   that are accessed through the                   same menu must be tested.            3. Where    user input is provided,  all functions  must be tested with both correct and                   incorrect  input.                 It is clear from  experience with major  software products such as word processors            or  spreadsheets that similar  guidelines  are normally  used during  product  testing.            When features of  the software are used in isolation,  they normally  work.  Problems            arise, as Whittaker (2002) explains,  when combinations of less commonly  used fea-            tures have not  been tested together. He gives the example  of how,  in a commonly            used word  processor, using footnotes  with  a multicolumn   layout  causes incorrect            layout of  the text.                 Automated system testing is usually more difficult  than automated unit or compo-            nent testing. Automated  unit  testing relies  on predicting  the outputs then encoding            these predictions  in  a program.  The prediction   is then  compared with   the result.            However, the  point of  implementing  a system may  be to generate outputs that  are            large or cannot be easily predicted. You may be able to examine an output and check            its credibility   without necessarily being able to create it in advance.8.2 Test-driven                    development            Test-driven development  (TDD)  is  an approach to program  development in  which            you  interleave  testing  and code  development  (Beck,  2002;  Jeffries  and Melnik,            2007).  Essentially, you  develop  the code incrementally,  along  with  a test for  that            increment.  You don’t  move on  to the  next increment  until  the code that  you have            developed passes its test. Test-driven development  was introduced as part  of agile            methods such as Extreme Programming. However, it can also be used in plan-driven            development processes.239222 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                                 Identify New                    Pass                                                 Functionality                                                                                                                     Fail           Implement                                                   Write Test                Run Test                                Functionality and                                                                                                                                        RefactorFigure 8.9 Test-drivendevelopment                                       The  fundamental TDD  process is shown in  Figure  8.9. The steps in the process                                   are as follows:                                   1. You    start  by identifying    the increment  of  functionality   that is  required.  This                                          should normally  be small and implementable in a few lines of  code.                                   2. You    write  a test for this  functionality  and implement  this as an automated test.                                          This  means that the test can be executed and will  report  whether or  not it  has                                          passed or failed.                                   3. You    then  run the test,  along with  all  other  tests that have been implemented.                                          Initially,   you have not implemented  the functionality   so the new  test will  fail.                                          This is deliberate as it shows that the test adds something to the test set.                                   4. You    then  implement  the  functionality   and  re-run  the test. This  may  involve                                          refactoring existing code to improve it and add new code to what’s already there.                                   5. Once    all tests run successfully, you move on to implementing  the next chunk of                                          functionality.                                       An  automated testing environment,  such as the JUnit  environment that supports                                   Java program testing (Massol and Husted, 2003), is essential for  TDD.  As the code                                   is developed in very small increments, you have to be able to run every test each time                                   that you add functionality  or refactor the program. Therefore, the tests are embedded                                   in a separate program that runs the tests and invokes the system that is being tested.                                   Using this approach, it is possible to run hundreds of separate tests in a few seconds.                                       A  strong argument for test-driven development is that it helps programmers clarify                                   their ideas of what a code segment is actually supposed to do. To write a test, you need                                   to understand what  is intended,  as this understanding  makes it  easier to write  the                                   required code. Of course, if  you have incomplete knowledge  or understanding, then                                   test-driven development won’t help. If  you don’t know  enough to write the tests, you                                   won’t develop the required code. For example, if your computation involves division,                                   you should check that you are not dividing the numbers by zero. If you forget to write                                   a test for this, then the code to check will never be included in the program.                                       As  well  as better problem  understanding, other  benefits of  test-driven develop-                                   ment are:                                   1. Code    coverage In principle,   every code segment that you write  should have at                                          least one associated test. Therefore, you can be confident that all of the code in240                                                                      8.2 \\x02 Test-driven   development 223       the system has actually been executed. Code is tested as it is written so defects       are discovered early in the development process.2. Regression   testing A test suite is developed incrementally as a program is devel-       oped. You can always run regression tests to check that changes to the program       have not introduced new bugs.3. Simplified    debugging When a test fails, it  should be obvious where the problem       lies. The newly written  code needs to be checked and modified. You do not need       to use debugging tools to  locate the problem.  Reports of the use of  test-driven       development suggest that it is hardly ever necessary to use an automated debug-       ger in test-driven development (Martin,  2007).4. System   documentation The tests themselves act as a form of documentation that       describe what the code should be doing. Reading the tests can make it easier to       understand the code.    One of  the most important  benefits of  test-driven development is  that it  reducesthe costs of regression testing. Regression testing involves running test sets that havesuccessfully executed after changes have been made to a system. The regression testchecks that these changes have not introduced new bugs into the system and that thenew code interacts  as expected with  the existing  code. Regression testing  is veryexpensive and often impractical  when  a system is manually  tested, as the costs intime and effort are very high. In such situations, you have to try and choose the mostrelevant tests to re-run and it is easy to miss important tests.    However, automated testing, which  is fundamental to test-first  development, dra-matically   reduces the  costs of  regression  testing.  Existing   tests  may  be re-runquickly and cheaply. After  making a change to a system in test-first development, allexisting tests must run  successfully before any  further functionality   is added. As  aprogrammer, you can be confident that the new functionality that you have added hasnot caused or revealed problems with existing code.    Test-driven  development is of most  use in new software development  where thefunctionality   is either  implemented  in  new code or  by using  well-tested  standardlibraries. If  you are reusing large code components or legacy systems then you needto write  tests for  these systems as a whole. Test-driven  development  may also beineffective with  multi-threaded  systems. The different threads may be interleaved atdifferent times in  different test runs, and so may produce different results.    If  you use test-driven development, you still  need a system testing process to val-idate the system; that is, to check that it meets the requirements of all  of the systemstakeholders. System testing also tests performance, reliability,  and checks that thesystem does not do things  that it  shouldn’t do,  such as produce unwanted outputs,etc. Andrea  (2007) suggests how  testing tools  can be extended  to integrate  someaspects of system testing with TDD.    Test-driven  development has proved  to be a successful  approach for small  andmedium-sized projects. Generally, programmers who have adopted this approach arehappy with  it  and find  it a  more productive  way to  develop software  (Jeffries and241224 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                   Melnik,  2007). In some trials, it has been shown to lead to improved code quality; in                                   others, the results have been inconclusive. However, there is no evidence that TDD                                   leads to poorer quality code.                      8.3 Release                testing                                   Release testing  is the  process of  testing  a particular   release of  a system  that  is                                   intended for use outside of the development team. Normally, the system release is for                                   customers and users. In a complex project,  however, the release could be for  other                                   teams that are developing related systems. For software products, the release could                                   be for product management who then prepare it for sale.                                       There  are two important  distinctions  between release testing and system testing                                   during the development process:                                   1. A    separate team that has not been involved in the system development should be                                          responsible for release testing.                                   2. System   testing by  the development team should focus on discovering bugs in the                                          system (defect testing). The objective of release testing is to check that the system                                          meets its requirements and is good enough for external use (validation testing).                                       The  primary goal  of the release testing process is to convince the supplier of  the                                   system that it is good enough for  use. If so, it  can be released as a product or deliv-                                   ered to the customer. Release testing, therefore, has to show that the system delivers                                   its specified  functionality,  performance, and dependability,  and that it  does not fail                                   during normal  use. It  should take into  account all  of  the system requirements, not                                   just the requirements of the end-users of the system.                                       Release testing is usually a black-box testing process where tests are derived from                                   the system specification.  The system is treated as a black  box whose behavior  can                                   only be determined by studying  its inputs and the related outputs. Another name for                                   this is ‘functional   testing’, so-called because the tester is only concerned with func-                                   tionality  and not the implementation of  the software.                     8.3.1 Requirements-based               testing                                   A general principle  of  good requirements engineering  practice is that requirements                                   should be testable; that  is, the requirement  should  be written  so that a test can  be                                   designed for that requirement. A tester can then check that the requirement has been                                   satisfied. Requirements-based testing, therefore, is a systematic approach to test case                                   design  where  you  consider  each  requirement   and  derive  a set  of  tests  for  it.                                   Requirements-based testing is validation  rather than defect testing—you  are trying                                   to demonstrate that the system has properly implemented its requirements.242                                                                                                    8.3 \\x02 Release   testing 225                   For example,  consider related  requirements  for  the MHC-PMS   (introduced  in              Chapter 1), which are concerned with checking  for drug allergies:                   If a patient is known to be allergic to any particular   medication, then prescrip-                   tion of  that medication  shall result  in a warning  message being issued to the                   system user.                       If  a prescriber  chooses to ignore  an allergy  warning,  they shall provide  a                   reason why this has been ignored.                   To check if these requirements have been satisfied, you may need to develop sev-              eral related tests:              1. Set    up a patient record with  no known allergies.  Prescribe medication for aller-                     gies that are known to exist.  Check that a warning message is not issued by the                     system.              2. Set    up a patient record with a known allergy. Prescribe the medication to that the                     patient is allergic  to, and check that the warning is issued by the system.              3. Set    up  a patient record  in which  allergies  to two  or more  drugs are recorded.                     Prescribe both of  these drugs separately and check that the correct warning for                     each drug is issued.              4. Prescribe    two drugs  that the patient is allergic  to. Check that  two warnings  are                     correctly  issued.              5. Prescribe    a drug that issues a warning and overrule that warning. Check that the                     system requires the user to provide information explaining why  the warning was                     overruled.                   You can see from this that testing a requirement does not mean just writing a sin-              gle test. You normally have to write  several tests to ensure that you have coverage of              the requirement. You should also maintain traceability records of your requirements-              based testing, which link  the tests to the specific requirements that are being tested.8.3.2 Scenario          testing              Scenario testing is an approach to release testing where you devise typical scenarios              of use and use these to develop test cases for the system. A scenario is  a story that              describes one way in which  the system might be used. Scenarios should be realistic              and real system users should be able to relate to them. If you have used scenarios as              part of the requirements engineering process (described in Chapter 4), then you may              be able to reuse these as testing scenarios.                   In a short  paper on scenario testing,  Kaner (2003)  suggests that a scenario test              should be  a narrative story  that is  credible and  fairly  complex.  It  should motivate              stakeholders; that is, they should relate to the scenario and believe that it is important243226 Chapter        8 \\x02 Software       testing     Kate is a nurse who specializes in mental health care. One of her responsibilities is to  visit patients at home to     check that their treatment  is effective and that they are not suffering from  medication side effects.          On a day for home visits, Kate logs into the MHC-PMS and uses it to print her schedule of home visits for that     day, along with summary information about  the patients to be visited. She requests that the records for these     patients be downloaded  to her laptop. She is prompted for her key phrase to encrypt the records on the laptop.          One of the  patients that she visits is Jim, who is being treated with  medication for depression. Jim feels that     the medication  is helping him but  believes that it has the side effect of keeping  him awake at night. Kate looks     up Jim’s record and is prompted  for her key phrase to decrypt the record. She checks the drug prescribed and     queries its side effects. Sleeplessness is a known side effect so she notes the problem in Jim’s record and     suggests that he visits the clinic to have his medication changed. He agrees so Kate enters a prompt to call him     when she gets back to the clinic  to make an appointment  with a physician. She ends the consultation and the     system re-encrypts Jim’s record.          After, finishing her consultations, Kate returns to  the clinic and uploads the records of patients  visited to the     database. The system generates a call list for Kate of those patients who she has to contact for follow-up     information  and make clinic appointments.                                       that  the  system   passes the  test.  He  also   suggests  that  it  should   be  easy to  evaluate.

As   an  example    of   a possible    scenario    from    the  MHC-PMS,      Figure    8.10                                       describes   one way   that the  system  may  be  used on  a home  visit.                                             It  tests a number   of  features  of  the  MHC-PMS:                                       1. Authentication         by  logging    on to  the system.                                       2. Downloading         and  uploading   of  specified   patient   records  to  a laptop.                                       3. Home       visit   scheduling.                                       4.

Record       retrieval   and  modification.                                       6. Links       with   the  drugs  database  that  maintains   side-effect   information.                                       7. The      system   for  call  prompting.                                             If  you   are  a  release   tester,  you   run   through   this   scenario,    playing    the  role   of                                       Kate   and  observing     how   the  system   behaves   in  response   to  different     inputs.    As                                       ‘Kate’,      you   may   make   deliberate     mistakes,     such   as  inputting      the  wrong     key                                       phrase   to  decode   records.   This   checks   the  response   of  the  system   to   errors.   You                                       should   carefully    note  any  problems    that  arise,  including     performance    problems.    If                                       a  system   is  too  slow,   this   will    change   the  way   that  it   is  used.  For   example,   if   it                                       takes  too   long  to  encrypt    a record,   then  users  who   are short   of  time   may  skip   this                                       stage.   If  they   then  lose   their   laptop,   an  unauthorized     person  could    then  view   the                                       patient   records.                                             When  you  use a scenario-based   approach,  you  are normally   testing   several require-                                       ments  within   the same scenario.  Therefore,  as well  as checking  individual    requirements,                                       you  are also  checking  that  combinations   of  requirements  do  not cause  problems.244                                                                                                    8.3 \\x02 Release   testing 2278.3.3 Performance           testing              Once a system has been completely integrated, it is possible to test for emergent prop-              erties, such as performance and reliability. Performance tests have to be designed to              ensure that the system can process its intended load. This usually involves running a              series of tests where  you increase the load  until  the system performance  becomes              unacceptable.                   As with   other  types  of  testing,  performance   testing  is  concerned  both with              demonstrating that the system meets its requirements and discovering problems and              defects  in   the  system.  To  test  whether   performance   requirements   are  being              achieved, you may  have to construct an operational  profile.  An  operational profile              (see Chapter 15) is a set of tests that reflect the actual mix of  work that will   be han-              dled by the system. Therefore, if  90% of  the transactions in a system are of type A;              5% of  type B; and the remainder  of types C, D,  and E, then you have to design the              operational profile   so that the vast majority  of  tests are of type  A.  Otherwise, you              will  not get an accurate test of the operational performance  of the system.                   This approach, of course, is  not necessarily the best approach for defect testing.              Experience has shown  that an effective  way  to discover  defects is  to design  tests              around the limits of  the system. In performance testing, this means stressing the sys-              tem by  making demands that are outside  the design limits  of  the software.  This is              known as ‘stress testing’.  For example, say you are testing a transaction processing              system that is  designed to process up to 300  transactions per second. You start by              testing this system with  fewer than 300 transactions per second. You then gradually              increase the load on the system beyond 300  transactions per second until it  is well              beyond the maximum  design load  of the system and the system fails.  This  type of              testing has two functions:              1. It     tests the failure behavior of  the system. Circumstances may arise through an                     unexpected combination of events where the load placed on the system exceeds                     the maximum  anticipated load. In  these circumstances, it is important  that sys-                     tem failure should not cause data corruption or unexpected loss of user services.                     Stress testing checks that overloading  the system causes it to  ‘fail-soft’   rather                     than collapse under its load.              2. It    stresses the system and may cause defects to come to light that would not nor-                     mally  be discovered. Although it can be argued that these defects are unlikely to                     cause system failures in  normal  usage, there may be unusual combinations  of                     normal circumstances that the stress testing replicates.                   Stress testing is particularly relevant to distributed systems based on a network of              processors. These systems often exhibit  severe degradation when they  are heavily              loaded. The  network  becomes swamped with  coordination   data that the  different              processes must exchange. The processes become slower and slower as they wait for              the required data from  other  processes. Stress testing helps you discover when the              degradation begins so that you  can add checks to the  system to reject  transactions              beyond this point.245228 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                      8.4 User             testing                                   User or customer testing is a stage in the testing process in which users or customers                                   provide input and advice on system testing. This may involve  formally  testing a sys-                                   tem that has been commissioned from an external supplier,  or could be an informal                                   process where users experiment with a new software product to see if they like it and                                   that it does what they need. User testing is essential, even when comprehensive sys-                                   tem and release testing have been carried out. The reason for this is  that influences                                   from  the user’s working  environment have a major  effect on  the reliability,  perfor-                                   mance, usability, and robustness of a system.                                        It is practically  impossible for  a system developer to replicate the system’s work-                                   ing environment, as tests in the developer’s environment are inevitably artificial.  For                                   example, a system that is intended for use in a hospital is used in a clinical  environ-                                   ment where other  things are going  on, such  as patient emergencies, conversations                                   with relatives, etc. These all affect the use of a system, but developers cannot include                                   them in their testing environment.                                        In practice, there are three different types of user testing:                                   1. Alpha     testing, where users of the software  work with  the development team to                                          test the software at the developer’s site.                                   2. Beta    testing, where a release of the software is made available to users to allow                                          them to  experiment  and to raise problems  that they  discover with  the  system                                          developers.                                   3. Acceptance    testing, where customers test a system to decide whether or not it is                                          ready to be accepted from the system developers and deployed in the customer                                          environment.                                        In alpha testing, users and developers work together to test a system as it is being                                   developed. This means that the users can identify  problems  and issues that are not                                   readily apparent to  the development testing team. Developers can only  really  work                                   from the requirements but these often do not reflect other factors that affect the prac-                                   tical use of the software. Users can therefore provide information  about practice that                                   helps with the design of more realistic  tests.                                        Alpha testing  is often  used when developing  software products  that are sold as                                   shrink-wrapped systems. Users of  these products may be willing  to  get involved in                                   the alpha testing process because this gives them early information   about new sys-                                   tem features that they can exploit. It also reduces the risk that unanticipated changes                                   to the software will  have disruptive effects on their  business. However, alpha testing                                   may also be used when custom software is being developed. Agile methods, such as                                   XP, advocate user involvement   in the  development process and that  users should                                   play a key role in designing  tests for the system.                                        Beta testing takes place when an early,  sometimes unfinished, release of a soft-                                   ware system is  made available to  customers and users for evaluation.

Beta testing  is mostly  used for  software  products that  are used in                                   many different  environments  (as opposed to  custom systems which  are generally                                   used in a defined environment). It  is impossible for  product developers to know and                                   replicate  all the  environments in  which  the  software will   be used. Beta testing  is                                   therefore essential to discover  interaction  problems between the  software and fea-                                   tures of the environment where it is used. Beta testing is also a form of  marketing—                                   customers learn about their system and what it can do for them.                                        Acceptance testing is  an inherent part of  custom systems development. It  takes                                   place after release testing. It involves a customer formally testing a system to decide                                   whether or not it should be accepted from the system developer. Acceptance implies                                   that payment should be made for the system.                                        There are six stages in the acceptance testing process, as shown in Figure  8.11.                                   They are:                                   1. Define     acceptance criteria This   stage should,  ideally,  take place  early in  the                                          process before  the contract  for  the system is  signed. The acceptance criteria                                          should be part of  the system contract and be agreed between the customer and                                          the developer. In practice, however, it  can be difficult  to define criteria  so early                                          in the process. Detailed requirements may not be available and there may be sig-                                          nificant  requirements change during the development process.                                   2. Plan     acceptance  testing This  involves   deciding  on the  resources, time,  and                                          budget for  acceptance testing and establishing  a testing  schedule. The accep-                                          tance test plan should also discuss the required coverage of the requirements and                                          the order in which system features are tested. It should define risks to the testing                                          process, such as system crashes and inadequate performance, and discuss how                                          these risks can be mitigated.                                   3. Derive     acceptance tests Once acceptance criteria  have been established, tests                                          have to be designed to check whether or not a system is acceptable. Acceptance                                          tests should aim  to test both  the functional  and  non-functional  characteristics                                          (e.g., performance) of the system. They should, ideally, provide complete cover-                                          age of the system requirements. In practice, it is difficult  to establish completely                                          objective acceptance criteria. There  is often scope for  argument about whether                                          or not a test shows that a criterion has definitely been met.247230 Chapter    8 \\x02 Software    testing                                   4. Run    acceptance tests The agreed acceptance tests are executed on the system.                                          Ideally,  this should take place in  the actual environment where the  system will                                          be used, but this  may be  disruptive  and impractical.  Therefore,  a user testing                                          environment may  have to be set up to run these tests. It is difficult   to automate                                          this process as part of the acceptance tests may involve testing  the interactions                                          between end-users and the system. Some training of end-users may be required.                                   5. Negotiate   test results It is very unlikely that all of the defined acceptance tests will                                          pass and that there will be no problems with  the system. If this  is the case, then                                          acceptance testing is complete and the system can be handed over. More com-                                          monly, some problems will   be discovered. In such cases, the developer and the                                          customer have to negotiate to decide if the system is good enough to be put into                                          use. They must also agree on the developer’s response to identified problems.                                   6. Reject/accept     system This  stage involves  a meeting  between  the developers                                           and the customer to decide on whether or not the system should be accepted. If                                          the system  is not  good enough for  use, then  further  development is  required                                          to fix  the identified   problems. Once complete,  the acceptance testing phase is                                          repeated.                                        In agile methods, such as XP, acceptance testing has a rather different meaning. In                                   principle,  it shares the notion that  users should decide whether or not the system is                                   acceptable. However, in XP, the user is part of the development team (i.e., he or she                                   is an alpha  tester) and provides  the system requirements  in  terms of  user stories.                                    He or she is also responsible for defining  the tests, which decide whether or  not the                                   developed software supports the user story. The tests are automated and development                                   does not proceed until the story acceptance tests have passed. There is, therefore, no                                   separate acceptance testing activity.                                        As I have discussed in Chapter 3, one problem with user involvement is ensuring                                   that the user who is embedded in the development team is a ‘typical’  user with  gen-                                   eral knowledge of how the system will  be used. It can be difficult to find  such a user,                                   and so  the  acceptance tests  may  actually   not  be a  true  reflection   of  practice.                                   Furthermore, the requirement for  automated testing severely limits  the flexibility   of                                   testing interactive systems. For such systems, acceptance testing may require groups                                   of end-users to use the system as if it was part of their everyday work.                                        You might think  that acceptance testing is a clear-cut contractual  issue. If a sys-                                   tem does not pass its acceptance tests, then it should not  be accepted and payment                                   should not be made. However, the  reality is  more complex. Customers want  to use                                   the software  as soon as they can because of the benefits  of its  immediate  deploy-                                   ment.  They  may  have  bought  new  hardware,  trained   staff,  and  changed  their                                   processes. They may  be willing   to accept  the software,  irrespective  of problems,                                   because the costs of not  using  the software  are greater than the  costs of working                                   around the problems.  Therefore,  the outcome  of  negotiations may  be conditional                                   acceptance of the system. The customer may accept the system so that deployment                                   can begin. The system provider  agrees to repair urgent problems and deliver  a new                                   version to the customer as quickly as possible.248                                                                                                             Chapter  8 \\x02 Further   reading 231  KEY     POINTS       \\x02 Testing   can only show the presence of errors in a program.

A separate team             should be responsible for testing  a system before it is released to customers.

When you have read this chapter, you will:            \\x02 understand that change is inevitable if software systems are to                remain useful and that software development and evolution may                be integrated in a spiral model;            \\x02 understand software evolution processes and influences on these                processes;            \\x02 have learned about different types of software maintenance and                the factors that affect maintenance costs; and            \\x02 understand how legacy systems can be assessed to decide                whether they should be scrapped, maintained, reengineered,                or replaced.

After a system has been deployed, it inevitablyhas to change if it is to remain  useful. Business changes and changes to user expec-tations generate new requirements  for the  existing  software. Parts of  the softwaremay have to be modified to correct  errors that are found in operation, to  adapt it forchanges to its hardware and software  platform,  and to improve  its  performance orother non-functional characteristics.    Software   evolution   is  important   because organizations   have  invested  largeamounts of money in their software and are now completely dependent on these sys-tems. Their  systems are critical  business assets and they have to invest  in  systemchange to maintain  the value of  these assets. Consequently, most large companiesspend more on  maintaining  existing  systems  than on new  systems development.Based on an informal industry poll, Erlikh  (2000) suggests that 85–90% of organiza-tional software costs are evolution costs. Other surveys suggest that about two-thirdsof software  costs are evolution  costs. For sure, the costs of  software  change are alarge part of the IT budget for all  companies.    Software  evolution   may  be triggered  by  changing  business requirements,   byreports of software  defects, or by  changes to other systems in  a software system’senvironment. Hopkins and Jenkins (2008) have coined the term ‘brownfield softwaredevelopment’ to describe situations in which  software systems have to be developedand managed in an environment where they  are dependent on many other softwaresystems.    Therefore,   the  evolution  of   a system  can  rarely  be considered   in  isolation.Changes to the environment   lead to system  change that may  then trigger  furtherenvironmental changes. Of course, the fact that systems have to evolve in a ‘systems-rich’  environment often increases the difficulties  and costs of  evolution. As  well  asunderstanding and analyzing an impact  of  a proposed change on the system itself,you may  also have to assess how this may  affect other  systems in the operationalenvironment.    Useful  software systems often have a very long lifetime. For example, large mili-tary or infrastructure systems, such as air traffic control systems, may have a lifetimeof 30 years or  more. Business systems are often more than  10 years old. Softwarecost a lot of money so a company has to use a software system for many years to geta return  on its  investment.  Obviously,  the  requirements  of  the installed  systemschange as the business and its environment change. Therefore, new releases of thesystems, incorporating changes, and updates, are usually created at regular intervals.    You  should,  therefore,  think  of  software  engineering  as a spiral  process withrequirements, design, implementation, and testing  going on throughout  the lifetimeof the system (Figure 9.1). You start by creating release 1 of the system. Once deliv-ered, changes are proposed and the development of release 2 starts almost immedi-ately. In fact, the need for evolution  may become obvious even before the system isdeployed so that later releases of the software may be under development before thecurrent version has been released.    This  model of software evolution  implies that a single organization is responsiblefor both  the initial   software development  and the evolution  of  the software.

For custom software,                                   a different approach is commonly used. A software company develops software for a                                   customer and the customer’s own development staff then take over the system. They                                   are responsible for  software evolution.  Alternatively,   the software  customer might                                   issue a separate contract to a different company for system support and evolution.                                        In this case, there are likely to be discontinuities in the spiral process. Requirements                                   and design documents may not be passed from one company to another. Companies                                   may merge or reorganize and inherit  software from  other companies, and then find                                   that this has to be changed. When the transition from development to evolution is not                                   seamless, the process of changing the software  after delivery  is  often called  ‘soft-                                   ware maintenance’.  As  I discuss later  in  this chapter, maintenance  involves  extra                                   process activities, such as program understanding, in  addition  to the normal  activi-                                   ties of software development.                                        Rajlich and Bennett (2000) proposed an alternative view of the software evolution                                   life  cycle, as shown in Figure 9.2. In this  model, they distinguish  between evolution                                   and servicing.  Evolution  is the  phase in which  significant  changes to the software                                   architecture and functionality  may be made. During servicing,  the only changes that                                   are made are relatively small, essential changes.                                        During evolution,  the software is used successfully and there is a constant stream                                   of proposed requirements changes. However, as the software is  modified,  its struc-                                   ture tends to degrade and changes become more and more expensive. This often hap-                                   pens after a few years of  use when other environmental changes, such as hardware                                   and operating systems, are also often required.  At  some stage in the life  cycle, the                                   software reaches a transition  point  where  significant  changes, implementing   new                                   requirements, become less and less cost effective.                                           Initial                                                                            Evolution                      Servicing                     PhaseoutFigure 9.2 Evolution Developmentand servicing254                                                                                                                 9.1 \\x02 Evolution    processes 237                                                                                      Change Identification                                                                                                Process                                                              New System                                     Change ProposalsFigure 9.3 Change                                                          Software Evolutionidentification and                                                                     Processevolution processes                                       At  that stage, the software moves from evolution  to servicing.  During the servic-                                   ing phase, the software  is still  useful  and used but only  small  tactical changes are                                   made to it. During  this  stage, the company is usually considering  how the software                                   can be replaced. In the final  stage, phase-out, the software may still  be used but no                                   further  changes are being implemented.  Users have to work  around any  problems                                   that they discover.                       9.1 Evolution                  processes                                   Software evolution  processes vary depending on  the type of  software being  main-                                   tained, the development processes used in an organization and the skills of the peo-                                   ple involved.  In  some organizations, evolution  may  be an informal   process where                                   change requests mostly  come  from  conversations  between the  system users and                                   developers. In other companies, it is a formalized  process with structured documen-                                   tation produced at each stage in the process.                                       System change proposals are the driver for system evolution  in all  organizations.                                   Change proposals may come from  existing requirements that  have not been imple-                                   mented in the released system, requests for new requirements, bug reports from system                                   stakeholders, and new ideas for software improvement from the system development                                   team. The processes of change identification   and  system evolution  are cyclic  and                                   continue throughout the lifetime  of a system (Figure 9.3).                                       Change proposals should be linked  to the components of the system that have to                                   be modified to implement  these proposals. This allows the cost and the impact of the                                   change to be assessed. This is part of  the general process of  change management,                                   which  also should ensure that  the correct  versions of  components are included  in                                   each system release.

The cost and impact of                                   these changes are assessed to see how much of the system is affected by the change and                                   how much it might cost to implement the change. If the proposed changes are accepted,                                   a new release of the system is planned. During release planning, all proposed changes                                   (fault repair, adaptation, and new functionality) are considered. A decision is then made                                   on which  changes to implement in  the next version of  the system. The changes are                                   implemented and validated, and a new version of the system is released. The process                                   then iterates with a new set of changes proposed for the next release.                                        You can  think  of  change implementation    as an iteration   of  the development                                   process, where the revisions  to the system are designed, implemented,  and tested.                                   However, a critical  difference  is that the  first stage of  change implementation  may                                   involve program  understanding, especially if  the original  system developers are not                                   responsible for  change implementation.  During  this program  understanding phase,                                   you have to understand how the program is structured, how it  delivers functionality,                                   and how the proposed change might affect the program. You need this understanding                                   to make sure that the implemented  change does not cause new problems when it is                                   introduced into the existing  system.                                        Ideally, the change implementation  stage of this  process should modify  the sys-                                   tem specification,  design, and implementation  to  reflect the  changes to the system                                   (Figure 9.5).  New requirements  that reflect  the system changes are proposed, ana-                                   lyzed, and validated.  System components are redesigned and implemented and the                                   system is retested. If appropriate, prototyping  of  the proposed changes may be car-                                   ried out as part of the change analysis process.                                        During the evolution process, the requirements are analyzed in detail and implica-                                   tions of  the changes emerge that were  not apparent in  the earlier  change analysis                                   process. This means that  the proposed changes may be modified   and further  cus-                                   tomer discussions may be required before they are implemented.                                        Change requests sometimes relate  to system problems  that  have to be tackled                                   urgently. These urgent changes can arise for three reasons:                                   1.

If     there are unanticipated changes to the  business running the system, such as                                          the emergence of  new competitors  or the  introduction  of  new legislation  that                                          affects the system.                                       In  these cases, the need to make the change quickly means that you may  not be                                   able to follow  the formal  change analysis process. Rather than modify  the require-                                   ments and design, you make an emergency fix to  the program to solve the immedi-                                   ate problem (Figure 9.6). However, the danger is that the requirements, the software                                   design, and the code become inconsistent.  Although  you  may intend  to document                                   the change in the requirements  and design, additional  emergency fixes to  the soft-                                   ware may then be needed. These take priority  over documentation.  Eventually,  the                                   original   change is  forgotten  and  the system  documentation   and code are  never                                   realigned.                                       Emergency  system repairs usually have to  be completed as quickly  as possible.                                   You chose a quick and workable solution  rather than the best solution as far as sys-                                   tem structure is  concerned. This accelerates the process of software ageing  so that                                   future changes become progressively more difficult  and maintenance costs increase.                                       Ideally,  when emergency code repairs are made the change request should remain                                   outstanding after the code faults have been fixed. It can then be reimplemented more                                   carefully  after further analysis. Of  course, the code of the repair may be reused. An                                   alternative,  better solution  to  the problem  may  be discovered when  more time  is                                   available for analysis. In practice, however, it is almost inevitable that these improve-                                   ments will   have  a low  priority.   They  are often  forgotten   and, if   further  system                                   changes are made, it then becomes unrealistic to redo the emergency repairs.                                       Agile   methods and processes, discussed in Chapter 3, may be used for program                                   evolution as well  as program development. In fact, because these methods are based                                   on incremental development, making the  transition from  agile development to post-                                   delivery evolution should be seamless. Techniques such as automated regression testing                                   are useful when system changes are made. Changes may be expressed as user stories                                   and customer involvement can prioritize  changes that are required in an operational                                   system. In short, evolution simply involves continuing the agile development process.257240 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                       However,  problems may  arise in situations  in which  there is  a handover from  a                                   development team to a separate team responsible for evolution. There are two poten-                                   tially  problematic situations:                                   1. Where    the development team has used an agile approach but the evolution team                                          is unfamiliar  with  agile methods and prefers a plan-based approach. The evolu-                                          tion  team may expect detailed  documentation  to support evolution  and this  is                                          rarely produced in  agile processes. There may be no definitive statement of the                                          system requirements that can be modified as changes are made to the system.                                   2. Where    a plan-based approach has been used for development but the evolution                                          team prefers to use agile methods. In this case, the evolution team may  have to                                          start from  scratch developing automated tests and the code  in the system may                                          not have been refactored and simplified  as is expected in agile development. In                                          this case, some reengineering may be required to improve the code before it can                                          be used in an agile development process.                                   Poole and Huisman (2001) report on their experiences in using Extreme Programming                                   for  maintaining  a large  system that  was originally   developed  using a plan-based                                   approach. After reengineering the system to improve its structure, XP was used very                                   successfully in the maintenance process.                      9.2 Program                 evolution            dynamics                                   Program evolution dynamics is the study of  system change. In the 1970s and 1980s,                                   Lehman and Belady  (1985) carried  out several empirical  studies of system change                                   with  a view to understanding more  about characteristics of software evolution.  The                                   work continued  in the 1990s as Lehman and others investigated the  significance of                                   feedback in evolution processes (Lehman, 1996; Lehman et al., 1998; Lehman et al.,                                   2001). From these studies, they proposed ‘Lehman’s laws’ concerning system change                                   (Figure 9.7).                                       Lehman  and Belady  claim these laws are likely   to be true  for all  types of  large                                   organizational software systems (what they call  E-type systems). These are systems                                   in which  the  requirements  are changing to  reflect  changing business needs. New                                   releases of the system are essential for the system to provide business value.                                       The  first law  states that system maintenance is an inevitable process. As the sys-                                   tem’s environment changes, new requirements emerge and the system must be mod-                                   ified.  When the modified  system is reintroduced  to the environment,  this promotes                                   more environmental changes, so the evolution process starts again.                                       The second law states that, as a system is changed, its structure is degraded. The only                                   way to avoid this happening is to invest in  preventative maintenance. You spend time                                   improving  the software structure without  adding to its  functionality.  Obviously,  this                                   means additional costs, over and above those of implementing required system changes.258                                                                                                   9.2 \\x02 Program   evolution   dynamics 241    Law                                               Description    Continuing change                        A program that is used in a real-world environment must necessarily                                                          change, or else become progressively less useful in that environment.    Increasing complexity                   As an evolving program changes, its structure tends to become more                                                          complex. Extra resources must be devoted to preserving and simplifying                                                          the structure.    Large program evolution               Program evolution is a self-regulating process. System attributes such                                                          as size, time between releases, and the number of reported errors is                                                          approximately invariant for each system release.    Organizational stability                  Over a program’s lifetime, its rate of development is approximately constant                                                          and independent of the resources devoted to system development.    Conservation of familiarity             Over the lifetime of a system, the incremental change in each release is                                                          approximately constant.    Continuing growth                         The functionality offered by systems has to continually increase to                                                          maintain user satisfaction.    Declining quality                            The quality of systems will decline unless they are modified to reflect                                                          changes in their operational environment.    Feedback system                          Evolution processes incorporate multiagent, multiloop feedback systems                                                          and you have to treat them as feedback systems to achieve significant                                                          product improvement.                                       The  third   law  is,  perhaps, the  most  interesting  and  the  most contentious   ofFigure 9.7 Lehman’slaws                           Lehman’s  laws. It  suggests that large systems have a dynamic  of their  own  that is                                   established at an early stage in the development process. This determines the gross                                   trends of the system maintenance process and limits the number of  possible system                                   changes. Lehman and Belady suggest that this law is a consequence of structural fac-                                   tors that  influence  and  constrain  system change,  and organizational   factors that                                   affect the evolution process.                                       The  structural factors that affect the third  law come from  the complexity  of large                                   systems. As you change and extend a program, its structure tends to degrade. This is                                   true of all types of  system (not just software) and it occurs because you are adapting                                   a structure  intended for  one purpose for  a different   purpose. This  degradation,  if                                   unchecked, makes it  more and more  difficult   to make  further  changes to the pro-                                   gram. Making   small  changes reduces the extent of  structural  degradation  and so                                   lessens the risks of  causing serious system dependability  problems. If  you  try and                                   make large changes, there is a high probability  that these will  introduce new  faults.                                   These then inhibit further  program changes.                                       The  organizational factors that  affect the third  law reflect  the fact that large sys-                                   tems are usually  produced by  large organizations.  These companies have internal                                   bureaucracies that set the change budget for each system and control  the decision-                                   making  process. Companies have to make decisions  on the risks  and value of  the259242 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                   changes and the costs involved. Such decisions take time to make and, sometimes, it                                   takes longer to decide on the changes to be made than change implementation. The                                   speed of the organization’s decision-making  processes therefore governs the rate of                                   change of the system.                                       Lehman’s  fourth  law  suggests that most large programming   projects work  in  a                                   ‘saturated’ state. That is, a change to resources or staffing has imperceptible  effects                                   on the long-term evolution of  the system. This is consistent with the third law, which                                   suggests that program evolution  is  largely  independent of  management decisions.                                   This law  confirms  that  large software  development  teams are often  unproductive                                   because communication overheads dominate the work of the team.                                       Lehman’s   fifth  law  is  concerned  with  the change  increments  in  each system                                   release. Adding  new  functionality   to  a system inevitably   introduces  new system                                   faults. The  more functionality   added in each release, the more faults there will   be.                                   Therefore, a large increment  in functionality   in  one system release means that this                                   will  have  to be followed   by a  further  release in which  the  new system  faults are                                   repaired. Relatively  little  new functionality   should be included in  this release. This                                   law suggests that you  should not budget for  large functionality   increments in  each                                   release without taking into  account the need for fault repair.                                       The  first  five laws  were in Lehman’s  initial  proposals; the remaining  laws were                                   added after further work.  The sixth and seventh laws are similar  and essentially say                                   that users of software  will   become increasingly unhappy  with  it  unless it is  main-                                   tained and new  functionality   is added to it.  The  final  law reflects  the most  recent                                   work on  feedback processes, although it is not yet  clear how this  can be applied in                                   practical software development.                                       Lehman’s   observations  seem generally   sensible.  They  should  be  taken  into                                   account when planning the maintenance process. It may be that business considera-                                   tions require  them to be  ignored at any  one time. For  example, for  marketing rea-                                   sons, it may be necessary to make several major system changes in a single release.                                   The likely  consequences of this are that one or more releases devoted to error repair                                   are likely  to be required.  You often  see this in personal computer  software when a                                   major new release of an application is often quickly followed  by a bug repair update.                       9.3 Software                 maintenance                                   Software maintenance is the general process of changing a system after it  has been                                   delivered. The term is usually applied to custom software in which  separate develop-                                   ment groups are involved before and after delivery. The changes made to the software                                   may be simple changes to correct  coding errors, more extensive changes to correct                                   design errors, or significant  enhancements to correct specification  errors or accom-                                   modate new requirements. Changes are implemented by modifying  existing  system                                   components and, where necessary, by adding new components to the system.                                       There are three different  types of software maintenance:260                                                                          9.3 \\x02 Software    maintenance 2431. Fault    repairs Coding  errors are usually relatively cheap to correct; design errors       are more expensive as they may involve rewriting several program components.       Requirements errors are the most expensive to  repair because of the extensive       system redesign which may be necessary.2. Environmental     adaptation This    type of  maintenance  is required  when  some       aspect of the system’s environment such as the hardware, the platform operating       system, or  other support  software  changes. The  application  system  must be       modified to  adapt it to cope with these environmental changes.3. Functionality     addition This   type of maintenance is necessary when the system       requirements change in response to organizational or business change. The scale       of the changes required to the software is often  much greater than for the other       types of maintenance.    In  practice,  there is  not a clear-cut  distinction   between these types of  mainte-nance. When you adapt the system to a new environment, you may add functionalityto take advantage of new environmental features. Software faults  are often exposedbecause users use the system in unanticipated ways. Changing the system to accom-modate their way of working  is the best way to fix  these faults.    These types of maintenance are generally  recognized but different  people some-times give  them different  names. ‘Corrective   maintenance’  is universally   used torefer to maintenance  for fault  repair.  However, ‘adaptive  maintenance’ sometimesmeans adapting to a new environment and sometimes means adapting the software tonew requirements. ‘Perfective  maintenance’  sometimes means perfecting the  soft-ware by implementing   new requirements;  in other  cases it means maintaining  thefunctionality  of the system but improving  its structure and its performance. Becauseof this naming uncertainty, I have avoided the use of all of these terms in this chapter.    There  have been several studies of software maintenance which  have looked  atthe relationships   between maintenance  and  development  and between  differentmaintenance activities (Krogstie et al., 2005;  Lientz and Swanson, 1980; Nosek andPalvia, 1990;  Sousa, 1998). Because of  differences  in terminology,   the details  ofthese studies cannot be compared. In  spite of changes in  technology  and differentapplication domains, it seems that there has been remarkably little change in the dis-tribution of  evolution effort  since the 1980s.    The surveys broadly agree that software maintenance takes up a higher proportionof IT  budgets than  new development  (roughly  two-thirds   maintenance, one-thirddevelopment).  They also  agree that more  of  the maintenance  budget is  spent onimplementing  new requirements than on fixing  bugs. Figure  9.8 shows an approxi-mate distribution of maintenance costs. The specific percentages will obviously varyfrom one organization  to another but, universally,  repairing system faults  is not themost expensive maintenance activity. Evolving the system to cope with new environ-ments and new or changed requirements consumes most maintenance effort.    The  relative costs of maintenance and new  development vary from  one applica-tion domain to another. Guimaraes (1983) found that the maintenance costs for busi-ness application systems are broadly  comparable  with  system development costs.261244 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                                                                 Fault Repair                                                                                     (17%)                                                                                                            Functionality                                                                       Environmental                                                                                                             Addition or                                                                         Adaptation                                                                                                             Modification                                                                             (18%)                                                                                                                 (65%)Figure 9.8Maintenance effortdistribution                                   For embedded real-time systems, maintenance costs were up to four times more than                                   development costs. The high reliability   and performance requirements of these sys-                                   tems mean that  modules have to  be tightly   linked  and hence difficult    to change.                                   Although  these estimates are more than 25 years old, it is unlikely  that the cost dis-                                   tributions for  different types of  system have significantly changed.                                       It  is usually cost effective to invest effort in designing and implementing a system to                                   reduce the costs of future changes. Adding new functionality after delivery is expensive                                   because you have to spend time learning the system and analyzing the impact of the pro-                                   posed changes. Therefore, work done during development to make the software easier                                   to understand and change is likely to reduce evolution costs. Good software engineering                                   techniques, such as precise specification, the use of object-oriented development, and                                   configuration management, contribute to maintenance cost reduction.                                       Figure   9.9 shows  how  overall  lifetime   costs  may  decrease as more  effort  is                                   expended during system development to produce a maintainable system. Because of                                   the potential reduction in costs of understanding, analysis, and testing, there is a sig-                                   nificant  multiplier    effect  when  the system  is developed  for  maintainability.    For                                   System 1, extra  development costs of  $25,000  are invested in  making the  system                                   more maintainable. This  results in a savings of $100,000 in  maintenance costs over                                             System 1                                             System 2                                                                                                                                                              $Figure 9.9                                           0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500Development andmaintenance costs                     Development Costs         Maintenance Costs262                                                                                                        9.3 \\x02 Software    maintenance 245              Legacy systemsLegacy systems are old systems that are still useful and are sometimes critical to business operation. They maybe implemented using outdated languages and technology or may use other systems that are expensive tomaintain. Often their structure has been degraded by change and documentation is missing or out of date.Nevertheless, it may not be cost effective to replace these systems. They may only be used at certain timesof the year or it may be too risky to replace them because the specification has been lost.                                    http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/LegacySys/                              the lifetime  of  the system. This assumes that a percentage increase in development                              costs results in a comparable percentage decrease in overall system costs.                                  These estimates are hypothetical but there is no doubt that developing software to                              make it more maintainable is cost effective, when the whole life costs of the software                              are taken into  account. This  is the  rationale  for refactoring   in agile  development.                              Without  refactoring,  the  code becomes more and more  difficult   and expensive to                              change. However, in  plan-based development, the reality   is that additional  invest-                              ment in code improvement is rarely made during development. This is mostly  due to                              the ways most organizations run  their budgets. Investing in  maintainability  leads to                              short-term cost increases, which are measurable. Unfortunately, the long-term gains                              can’t be measured at the same time so companies are reluctant to spend money for an                              unknown future return.                                  It  is usually more expensive to add functionality after a system is in operation than                              it is to implement the same functionality during development. The reasons for this are:                              1. Team   stability After    a system has been delivered, it is  normal for  the develop-                                     ment team to  be broken up  and for people  to work  on new  projects. The new                                     team or the individuals   responsible for system maintenance do  not understand                                     the system or the  background to system design decisions.  They need to spend                                     time understanding the existing system before implementing  changes to it.                              2. Poor    development practice The contract to maintain a system is usually separate                                     from  the system development contract. The maintenance contract may be given                                     to a different   company rather than  the original  system developer. This  factor,                                     along with the lack of  team stability, means that there is no incentive for a devel-                                     opment team to write maintainable software. If  a development team can cut cor-                                     ners to save effort during development it is worthwhile  for them to do so, even if                                     this means that the software is more difficult  to change in the future.                              3. Staff   skills Maintenance staff are often relatively inexperienced and unfamiliar with                                     the application domain. Maintenance has a poor image among software engineers.                                     It is seen as a less-skilled process than system development and is often allocated to                                     the most junior staff. Furthermore, old systems may be written in obsolete program-                                     ming languages. The maintenance staff may not have much experience of develop-                                     ment in these languages and must learn these languages to maintain the system.263246 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                   Documentation     System documentation can help the maintenance process by providing maintainers with information about the     structure and organization of the system and the features that it offers to system users. Although proponents of     agile approaches such as XP suggest that the code should be the principal documentation, higher-level design     models and information about dependencies and constraints can make it easier to understand and make     changes to the code.     I have written a separate chapter on documentation that you can download.                          http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/ExtraChaps/Documentation.pdf                                   4. Program     age and structure As   changes are made to programs, their  structure                                          tends to degrade. Consequently, as programs age, they become harder to under-                                          stand and change. Some systems have been developed without modern software                                          engineering  techniques. They  may never have been well  structured  and were                                          perhaps optimized  for  efficiency  rather  than understandability.  System  docu-                                          mentation may be lost or inconsistent. Old systems may not have been subject to                                          stringent  configuration  management so time  is often  wasted finding   the right                                          versions of system components to change.                                        The first  three of these problems stem from the fact that many  organizations still                                   consider development and maintenance to be separate activities. Maintenance is seen                                   as a second-class activity and there is no incentive to spend money during development                                   to reduce the costs of system change. The only long-term solution to this problem is to                                   accept that systems rarely have a defined lifetime but continue in use, in some form,                                   for an indefinite  period. As  I suggested in the introduction, you  should think of  sys-                                   tems as evolving throughout their lifetime through a continual development process.                                        The fourth issue, the problem of degraded system structure, is the easiest problem                                   to address. Software reengineering techniques (described later in  this chapter) may                                   be applied  to  improve  the system  structure  and understandability.   Architectural                                   transformations can adapt the system to new hardware. Refactoring can improve the                                   quality  of the system code and make it easier to change.                     9.3.1 Maintenance            prediction                                   Managers hate surprises, especially if  these result in  unexpectedly high  costs. You                                   should therefore  try  to predict  what  system changes might  be proposed and what                                   parts of  the system are likely  to be the  most difficult   to maintain.  You should also                                    try  to estimate the  overall maintenance  costs for  a system in a given  time  period.                                   Figure 9.10 shows these predictions and associated questions.                                        Predicting the number of change requests for a system requires an understanding                                   of the relationship  between the system and its external environment.

To evaluate the relationshipsFigure 9.10Maintenance prediction between a system and its environment, you should assess:                                   1. The    number and complexity of system interfaces The larger the number of inter-                                          faces and the more complex these interfaces, the more likely  it  is that interface                                          changes will be required as new requirements are proposed.                                   2. The   number of inherently volatile system requirements As I discussed in Chapter 4,                                          requirements that reflect organizational  policies and procedures are likely  to be                                          more volatile than requirements that are based on stable domain characteristics.                                   3. The    business  processes in  which  the  system is  used As  business processes                                          evolve, they generate system change requests. The more business processes that                                          use a system, the more the demands for system change.                                        For many years, researchers have looked at the relationships between program com-                                   plexity, as measured by metrics such as cyclomatic complexity (McCabe, 1976), and                                   maintainability  (Banker et al., 1993; Coleman et al., 1994;  Kafura and Reddy, 1987;                                   Kozlov  et al., 2008). It  is not surprising  that these studies have found that the more                                   complex a system or  component, the more expensive it  is to maintain.  Complexity                                   measurements are particularly  useful  in  identifying   program components  that are                                   likely  to be expensive to maintain. Kafura  and Reddy (1987) examined a number of                                   system components and found that maintenance effort tended to be focused on a small                                   number of complex components. To reduce maintenance costs, therefore, you should                                   try to replace complex system components with simpler alternatives.                                        After a system has been put into service, you  may be able to use process data to                                   help  predict  maintainability.    Examples  of  process metrics  that  can  be used for                                   assessing maintainability are as follows:265248 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                   1. Number    of  requests for corrective  maintenance An  increase in  the number  of                                          bug and failure  reports may indicate that more  errors are being introduced into                                          the program than are being repaired during  the maintenance process. This may                                          indicate a decline in maintainability.                                   2. Average    time required for  impact analysis This  reflects the number of  program                                          components that are affected by the change request. If this time increases, it implies                                          more and more components are affected and maintainability is decreasing.                                   3. Average    time taken to  implement a change request This is  not the same as the                                          time for  impact analysis although it  may correlate with it.  This is the amount of                                          time that you  need to modify  the system and its documentation, after you  have                                          assessed which components  are affected.  An  increase in  the time  needed to                                          implement a change may indicate a decline in maintainability.                                   4. Number    of  outstanding change requests An  increase in this  number over time                                          may imply  a decline in maintainability.                                       You  use predicted information  about change requests and predictions about sys-                                   tem maintainability  to predict maintenance costs. Most managers combine this infor-                                   mation with  intuition   and experience to estimate costs. The COCOMO  2 model  of                                   cost estimation (Boehm et al., 2000),  discussed in Chapter 24, suggests that an esti-                                   mate for software maintenance effort can be based on the effort to understand exist-                                   ing code and the effort to develop the new code.                    9.3.2 Software           reengineering                                   As I  discussed in  the previous  section,  the process of  system  evolution  involves                                   understanding  the program  that  has to be changed  and then implementing   these                                   changes. However, many systems, especially  older legacy  systems, are difficult  to                                   understand and change. The programs may have been optimized for performance or                                   space utilization  at the expense of  understandability,  or, over time,  the initial   pro-                                   gram structure may have been corrupted by a series of changes.                                       To  make legacy software  systems easier to maintain,  you  can reengineer these                                   systems to improve their structure and understandability. Reengineering may involve                                   redocumenting the system, refactoring the system architecture, translating programs                                   to a modern programming  language, and modifying  and updating  the structure and                                   values of the  system’s data. The functionality   of  the software  is not  changed and,                                   normally, you should  try to avoid making  major changes to the system architecture.                                       There are two important  benefits from  reengineering rather than replacement:                                   1. Reduced    risk There  is  a high  risk in  redeveloping  business-critical   software.                                          Errors may  be made in the  system specification  or there may  be development                                          problems. Delays  in  introducing  the new  software may  mean that business is                                          lost and extra costs are incurred.266                                                                                                             9.3 \\x02 Software    maintenance 249                                                                               Program               Reengineered            Original                                                                                                                    Original Data            Program                                                Documentation             Program                                             Reverse                                          Engineering         Source Code                                                 Program                                     Data          Translation                                              Modularization                          Reengineering                                            Program                                            Structure                                         Improvement                                                                            Restructured                           Reengineered                                                                               Program                                     Data                                   2. Reduced   cost The  cost of reengineering may  be significantly  less than the costFigure 9.11 Thereengineering process      of  developing new software. Ulrich   (1990) quotes an example of a commercial                                          system for which the reimplementation  costs were estimated at $50 million. The                                          system was successfully reengineered for $12 million.  I suspect that, with mod-                                          ern software technology,  the relative cost of  reimplementation  is probably  less                                          than this but will  still  considerably exceed the costs of reengineering.                                       Figure  9.11 is  a general  model  of the  reengineering  process. The input  to  the                                   process is a legacy program and the output is an improved  and restructured version                                   of the same program. The activities in this  reengineering process are as follows:                                   1. Source   code translation Using   a translation tool, the program is converted from                                          an old programming  language to a more modern  version of the same language                                          or to a different  language.                                   2. Reverse   engineering The program is analyzed and information extracted from it.                                          This helps to document its organization  and functionality. Again,  this process is                                          usually completely  automated.                                   3. Program     structure  improvement The  control  structure of  the program  is ana-                                          lyzed and modified   to make it  easier to read and understand. This can be par-                                          tially  automated but some manual intervention is usually required.                                   4. Program    modularization Related  parts of the program are grouped together and,                                          where  appropriate,  redundancy  is  removed.  In  some  cases, this  stage may                                          involve  architectural refactoring  (e.g., a system that uses several different  data                                          stores may be refactored to use a single repository). This is a manual process.                                   5. Data     reengineering The  data processed by  the program  is changed to  reflect                                          program changes. This may mean redefining  database schemas and converting                                          existing  databases to the new structure.  You should  usually also  clean up the267250 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                                           Automated Program                           Program and Data                                                                Restructuring                                    Restructuring                                             Automated Source       Automated Restructuring         Restructuring Plus                                              Code Conversion          with Manual Changes          Architectural ChangesFigure 9.12Reengineering approaches                                                                                                                        Increased Cost                                          data. This involves finding  and correcting mistakes, removing duplicate records,                                          etc. Tools are available to support data reengineering.                                        Program reengineering may not necessarily require all of the steps in Figure 9.11.                                   You don’t need source code translation if you still use the application’s programming                                   language. If you can do all reengineering automatically, then recovering documenta-                                   tion  through reverse engineering  may be  unnecessary. Data reengineering is  only                                   required if the data structures in the program change during system reengineering.                                        To make the reengineered system interoperate with  the  new software, you  may                                   have to develop adaptor services, as discussed in Chapter 19. These hide the original                                   interfaces of  the software system and present new, better-structured  interfaces that                                   can be used by  other components.  This process of  legacy  system wrapping  is  an                                   important technique for  developing large-scale reusable services.                                        The costs of  reengineering obviously   depend on the extent  of  the work  that is                                   carried out. There is  a spectrum of possible approaches to reengineering, as shown                                   in Figure  9.12. Costs  increase from  left  to right  so that source code  translation  is                                   the cheapest option.  Reengineering  as part of  architectural  migration   is the most                                   expensive.                                        The problem with  software reengineering is that there are practical limits  to how                                   much you can improve a system by reengineering. It isn’t possible, for example, to con-                                   vert a system written using a functional approach to an object-oriented system. Major                                   architectural changes or radical reorganizing of the system data management cannot be                                   carried out  automatically,  so they are very  expensive. Although  reengineering can                                   improve maintainability, the reengineered system will probably not be as maintainable                                   as a new system developed using modern software engineering methods.                     9.3.3 Preventative           maintenance       by  refactoring                                   Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degra-                                   dation through change (Opdyke and Johnson, 1990). It means modifying a program to                                   improve  its structure,  to reduce its complexity,   or to make  it easier to  understand.                                   Refactoring is sometimes considered to be limited to object-oriented development but                                   the principles can be applied to any development approach. When you refactor a pro-                                   gram, you should not add functionality  but  should concentrate on program improve-                                   ment. You can therefore think of refactoring as ‘preventative maintenance’ that reduces                                   the problems of future change.268                                                                          9.3 \\x02 Software    maintenance 251    Although  reengineering and refactoring are both intended to make software easierto understand and change, they are not  the same thing.  Reengineering takes placeafter a system has been maintained for some time and maintenance costs are increas-ing. You use automated tools to process and reengineer a legacy system to create anew system  that  is  more maintainable.   Refactoring   is  a continuous   process ofimprovement throughout  the  development and evolution  process. It  is intended  toavoid the structure and code degradation that increases the costs and difficulties  ofmaintaining a system.    Refactoring  is  an inherent part of  agile  methods such as extreme programmingbecause these methods are based around change. Program quality is therefore liable todegrade quickly so agile developers frequently  refactor their programs  to avoid thisdegradation. The emphasis on regression testing in agile methods lowers the risk ofintroducing new errors through refactoring. Any  errors that are introduced should bedetectable as previously successful tests should then fail. However, refactoring is notdependent on other ‘agile activities’ and can be used with any approach to development.    Fowler  et al. (1999)  suggest that there are stereotypical situations (he calls them‘bad smells’)  in  which  the code  of a program  can be improved.  Examples  of badsmells that can be improved through refactoring include:1. Duplicate     code The  same of  very  similar  code may  be included  at  different       places in a program. This can be removed and implemented as a single method       or function  that is called as required.2. Long    methods If  a method is too  long, it  should be redesigned as a number of       shorter methods.3. Switch    (case)  statements These often  involve   duplication,   where the  switch       depends on the type  of  some value. The  switch  statements may be  scattered       around a program.  In  object-oriented  languages, you can  often use polymor-       phism to achieve the same thing.4. Data    clumping Data  clumps occur when the same group of data items (fields in       classes, parameters in methods) reoccur in several places in  a program. These       can often be replaced with an object encapsulating all of the data.5. Speculative     generality This   occurs  when developers  include  generality   in a       program in case it is required in future.  This can often simply  be removed.    Fowler,  in his book  and website, also suggests some primitive  refactoring trans-formations that can be used singly or together to deal with the bad smells. Examplesof these transformations include Extract method, where you remove duplication  andcreate a new  method;  Consolidate  conditional   expression,  where  you  replace asequence of tests with a single test; and Pull  up method, where you  replace similarmethods in subclasses with a single method in a super class. Interactive developmentenvironments,  such as Eclipse,  include  refactoring   support in  their  editors.  Thismakes it  easier to find  dependent  parts of  a program  that have  to be changed  toimplement the refactoring.269252 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                       Refactoring,   carried  out  during  program  development,  is  an effective  way  to                                   reduce the long-term  maintenance costs of a program. However, if  you  take over a                                   program for  maintenance whose structure  has been significantly  degraded, then  it                                   may be practically impossible  to refactor the code alone. You may also have to think                                   about design refactoring, which  is likely   to be a more expensive and difficult  prob-                                   lem. Design  refactoring  involves identifying   relevant design patterns (discussed in                                   Chapter 7) and replacing existing  code with code that implements  these design pat-                                   terns (Kerievsky, 2004). I don’t  have space to discuss this here.                      9.4 Legacy               system         management                                   For new software systems developed using modern software engineering processes,                                   such as incremental development and CBSE, it  is possible to  plan how to  integrate                                   system development and evolution. More and more companies are starting to under-                                   stand that the system development process is a whole life-cycle  process and that an                                   artificial   separation between  software  development  and software  maintenance is                                   unhelpful. However, there are still many legacy systems that are critical business sys-                                   tems. These have to be extended and adapted to changing e-business practices.                                       Most  organizations usually have a portfolio  of  legacy systems that they use, with                                   a limited  budget for maintaining  and upgrading these systems. They have to decide                                   how to  get the  best return  on  their  investment.  This  involves  making  a realistic                                   assessment of their legacy systems and then deciding on the most appropriate strat-                                   egy for evolving  these systems. There are four strategic options:                                   1. Scrap    the system completely This  option should be chosen when the  system is                                          not  making  an effective  contribution   to  business processes. This commonly                                          occurs when  business processes have changed since the system was installed                                          and are no longer reliant on the legacy system.                                   2. Leave     the system  unchanged and  continue   with  regular   maintenance This                                          option should be chosen when the system is still required but is fairly  stable and                                          the system users make relatively few change requests.                                   3. Reengineer    the  system to improve  its  maintainability This     option  should  be                                          chosen when the system quality has been degraded by change and where a new                                          change to the system is still being proposed. This process may include develop-                                          ing new interface  components so that the original  system can work  with other,                                          newer systems.                                   4. Replace    all or  part of  the system with a new system This option should be cho-                                          sen when factors, such as new hardware, mean that the old system cannot con-                                          tinue in operation or where off-the-shelf  systems would allow the new system to                                          be developed at a reasonable cost. In many cases, an evolutionary replacement                                          strategy can be adopted in which major system components are replaced by off-                                          the-shelf systems with other components reused wherever possible.270                                                                                                   9.4 \\x02 Legacy    system management 253                                                                High Business Value                                                                Low Quality                      High Business Value                                                                                                         High Quality                                                              9                                                                     10                                                                                                           6            8                                                                                                                   7                                                       Business Value                                                                 Low Business Value                          Low Business Value                                                                 Low Quality                                        High Quality                                                                           2                                                5                                                                     1            3                            4Figure 9.13 Anexample of a legacysystem assessment                                                    System Quality                                       Naturally,  these options are not exclusive. When a system is composed of several                                   programs, different options may  be applied to each program.                                       When  you are assessing a legacy system, you have to look  at it from  a business                                   perspective and a technical perspective (Warren, 1998). From a business perspective,                                   you have to decide whether or not the business really needs the system. From a tech-                                   nical perspective, you have to assess the quality of the application  software and the                                   system’s support software and hardware. You then use a combination of the business                                   value and the system quality to  inform  your decision on  what to do with  the legacy                                   system.                                       For  example,  assume that an organization  has 10  legacy systems.  You should                                   assess the quality and the business value of each of these systems. You may then cre-                                   ate a chart  showing relative  business value  and system  quality.  This  is shown  in                                   Figure 9.13.                                       From  Figure 9.13, you can see that there are four clusters of systems:                                   1. Low     quality,  low  business value Keeping  these systems  in operation  will   be                                          expensive and the rate of  the return to the  business will  be fairly  small. These                                          systems should be scrapped.                                   2. Low    quality,  high business value These systems are making an important busi-                                          ness contribution so they cannot be scrapped. However, their low quality means                                          that it  is expensive to maintain them.  These systems should be reengineered to                                          improve their quality.  They may be replaced, if a suitable off-the-shelf system is                                          available.                                   3. High     quality, low  business value These are systems that don’t contribute much                                          to the business but which may not be very expensive to maintain. It is not worth                                          replacing  these systems so normal  system  maintenance may  be continued  if                                          expensive changes are not  required and the  system hardware remains  in use.                                           If  expensive changes become necessary, the software should be scrapped.271254 Chapter    9 \\x02 Software    evolution                                   4. High     quality,  high business value These systems have to be kept in  operation.                                          However, their  high quality  means that you don’t  have to invest in  transforma-                                          tion or system replacement. Normal  system maintenance should be continued.                                       To  assess the business value of a system, you have to identify system stakehold-                                   ers, such as end-users of the system and their managers, and ask a series of questions                                   about the system. There are four basic issues that you have to discuss:                                   1. The    use of the system If systems are only used occasionally or by a small num-                                          ber of  people, they may have a low business value. A  legacy system may have                                          been developed to meet a business need that has either changed or that can now                                          be met more effectively  in  other ways. You  have to be careful, however, about                                          occasional but important use of systems. For example, in a university,  a student                                          registration  system may only  be used at the beginning  of each academic year.                                          However, it is an essential system with a high business value.                                   2. The    business processes that are supported When a system is introduced,  busi-                                          ness processes are designed to exploit the system’s capabilities. If the system is                                          inflexible,  changing  these business processes may be impossible. However, as                                          the environment changes, the original business processes may become obsolete.                                          Therefore, a system may have a low business value because it forces the use of                                          inefficient  business processes.                                   3. The    system dependability System dependability is not  only a technical problem                                          but also  a business problem. If   a system is not  dependable and the problems                                          directly  affect  the business customers or mean that people  in the business are                                          diverted from other tasks to solve these problems, the system has a low business                                          value.                                   4. The    system outputs The key issue here is the importance of the system outputs to                                          the successful functioning of  the business. If the business depends on these out-                                          puts, then the system has a high business value. Conversely, if these outputs can                                          be easily generated in some other way or if the system produces outputs that are                                          rarely used, then its business value may be low.                                       For  example, let’s assume that a company provides a travel ordering  system that                                   is used by  staff  responsible  for  arranging  travel.  They  can place  orders with   an                                   approved travel agent. Tickets  are then delivered  and the company  is invoiced  for                                   these. However, a business value assessment may reveal that this system is only used                                   for a fairly   small percentage of travel orders placed. People making  travel arrange-                                   ments find  it  cheaper and more  convenient  to deal  directly   with  travel  suppliers                                   through their  websites. This  system may still  be used, but there is  no real point  in                                   keeping it. The same functionality  is available from  external systems.                                       Conversely, say a company has developed a system that keeps track of all  previ-                                   ous customer orders and automatically generates reminders for customers to reorder                                   goods. This results in a large number of repeat orders and keeps customers satisfied272                                                                                                               9.4 \\x02 Legacy      system   management 255     Factor                                     Questions     Supplier stability                     Is the supplier still  in existence? Is the supplier financially stable and likely to                                                    continue  in existence? If the supplier is no longer in business, does someone else                                                    maintain  the systems?     Failure rate                             Does the hardware have a high rate of reported  failures? Does the support                                                    software crash and force system restarts?     Age                                         How old is the hardware and software? The older the hardware and support software,                                                    the more obsolete it will be. It may still function correctly but there could be significant                                                    economic and business benefits to moving to a more modern system.     Performance                           Is the performance of the system adequate? Do performance problems  have a                                                    significant effect on  system users?     Support requirements             What local support is required by the hardware  and software? If there are high                                                    costs associated with this support,  it may be worth  considering system                                                    replacement.     Maintenance costs                 What are the costs of hardware maintenance  and support software licences? Older                                                    hardware may have higher maintenance  costs than modern systems. Support                                                    software may have high  annual licensing costs.     Interoperability                        Are there problems interfacing the system to  other systems? Can compilers, for                                                    example, be used with  current versions of the operating system? Is hardware                                                    emulation  required?                                       because they  feel  that  their   supplier   is aware  of  their  needs.  The  outputs  from   such  aFigure 9.14 Factorsused in environment system        are  very   important     to   the  business   and  this   system   therefore     has  a highassessment                   business  value.                                            To  assess a  software   system   from   a technical    perspective,   you  need  to  consider                                       both  the application    system  itself   and  the environment    in  which   the system  operates.                                       The environment    includes   the  hardware  and  all  associated  support   software   (compil-                                       ers, development    environments,     etc.)  that  are  required   to  maintain   the  system.   The                                       environment    is important    because  many   system  changes  result   from   changes  to  the                                       environment,    such as upgrades   to the  hardware   or operating    system.                                            If  possible,   in  the  process  of  environmental     assessment,  you  should   make  meas-                                       urements  of  the system  and  its  maintenance   processes.  Examples   of  data that  may  be                                       useful  include    the  costs  of  maintaining    the  system   hardware   and  support   software,                                       the number   of hardware   faults  that  occur  over  some  time  period   and the  frequency   of                                       patches  and fixes  applied   to  the system   support  software.                                            Factors  that  you  should  consider   during   the environment    assessment  are shown   in                                       Figure  9.14.  Notice   that  these are not  all  technical   characteristics    of the  environment.                                       You also  have  to consider   the  reliability    of  the  suppliers   of the  hardware   and support                                       software.   If  these  suppliers   are  no  longer   in  business,  there  may   not  be  support  for                                       their  systems.                                            To  assess  the  technical    quality    of  an  application     system,   you  have   to  assess a                                       range  of  factors  (Figure   9.15)   that  are primarily    related   to  the system   dependability,273256 Chapter        9 \\x02 Software       evolution     Factor                                               Questions     Understandability                             How  difficult is it to  understand the source code of the current  system?

Documentation                                 What system documentation is available? Is the documentation complete,                                                              consistent, and current?     Data                                                 Is there an explicit data model for the system?

Performance                                    Is the performance  of the application  adequate? Do performance problems                                                              have a significant effect on system users?     Programming  language                   Are modern compilers available for the programming  language used to                                                              develop the system? Is the programming language still used for new  system                                                              development?     Configuration management              Are all versions of all parts of the system managed by a configuration                                                              management system? Is there an explicit description of the  versions of                                                              components that  are used in the current system?     Test data                                          Does test data for the system exist? Is there a record of regression tests                                                              carried out when  new features have been added to the  system?

You  mayFigure 9.15 Factorsused in application         also  collect   data  that will    help  you  judge  the  quality   of  the system.   Data  that  may  beassessment                    useful  in  quality   assessment  are:                                       1. The      number   of system  change  requests System    changes  usually   corrupt   the  sys-                                               tem  structure   and  make  further   changes  more  difficult.    The  higher   this  accumu-                                               lated  value,   the lower   the quality    of  the system.                                       2. The      number   of  user  interfaces This      is an  important    factor   in  forms-based    sys-                                               tems  where  each  form   can be  considered   as a separate  user  interface.   The  more                                               interfaces,   the  more  likely   that  there  will   be inconsistencies    and  redundancies   in                                               these  interfaces.                                       3. The      volume   of data   used by  the  system The   higher   the volume    of  data (number                                               of  files,   size  of  database,  etc.),   the  more  likely    that  it  is  that  there  will    be data                                               inconsistencies    that  reduce  the  system  quality.                                            Ideally,   objective   assessment  should   be used to  inform   decisions   about  what  to  do                                       with   a legacy  system.   However,   in  many  cases, decisions   are not  really   objective   but                                       are based  on organizational    or political    considerations.   For  example,  if  two  businesses                                       merge,  the  most  politically     powerful    partner  will    usually   keep its  systems   and scrap274                                                                                                              Chapter 9 \\x02 Further   reading 257                                   the other systems. If senior management in an organization decide to move to a new                                   hardware platform,  then this may require  applications to  be replaced. If there is  no                                   budget available for system transformation  in a particular year, then system mainte-                                   nance may be continued, even though this will result in higher long-term costs.

Suggest                how you might  set up a program to analyze the maintenance process and discover                appropriate  maintainability  metrics for your company.         9.5. Briefly  describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult                to distinguish  between them?         9.6. What are the principal factors that  affect the costs of system reengineering?         9.7. Under what circumstances might an organization decide to scrap a system when the system                assessment suggests that it is of high  quality and of high business value.         9.8. What are the strategic options  for legacy system evolution? When would you normally                replace all or part  of a system rather than continue maintenance of the software?         9.9. Explain why problems with  support software might  mean that an organization has to                replace its legacy systems.       9.10.

To trust a system, we must haveconfidence that it will be available when required and perform as expected.It must be secure so that our computers or data are not threatened by it.This means that issues of system dependability and security are often moreimportant than the details of system functionality. This part of the book hastherefore been designed to introduce students and practising softwareengineers to the important topics of dependability and security.   The first chapter in this section, Chapter 10, covers sociotechnical systems,   which at first sight, may not appear to have much to do with software   dependability. However, many security and dependability failures stem   from human and organizational causes and we cannot ignore these when   considering system dependability and security. Software engineers must   be aware of this and should not imagine that better techniques and tech-   nology can ensure that our systems are completely dependable and secure.   Chapter 11 introduces the basic concepts of dependability and security and   explains the fundamental principles of avoidance, detection, and recovery   that are used to build dependable systems. Chapter 12 supplements   Chapter 4, which covers requirements engineering, with a discussion of   specific approaches that are used for deriving and specifying system279requirements for security and dependability. I briefly introduce  the use offormal specification in Chapter 12, and an additional chapter on this topicis available on the Web.Chapters 13 and 14 are concerned with software engineering techniquesfor the development  of dependable and secure systems. I cover depend-ability  engineering  and security  engineering  separately, but  they  havemuch in common. I discuss the importance of software  architectures andpresent  design   guidelines   and  programming    techniques   that  helpachieve dependability and  security. I also explain  why it  is important  touse redundancy and diversity to  ensure that systems can cope with  fail-ures and external attacks. I introduce the  increasingly important  topic ofsoftware survivability  or resilience, which  allows systems to  continue todeliver essential services while their security  is being threatened.Finally, in this  section, Chapter 15 is  concerned with  dependability  andsecurity assurance. I explain the use of static  analysis and model check-ing for  system verification   and fault  detection.  These techniques  havebeen successfully used in critical  systems engineering. I also  cover spe-cific approaches to testing the dependability  and security of systems andexplain why a dependability case may be necessary to convince an exter-nal regulator that a system is safe and secure.28010Sociotechnical                                        systems            Objectives            The objectives of this chapter are to introduce the concept of a            sociotechnical system—a system that includes people, software,            and hardware—and to show that you need to take a systems            perspective on security and dependability. When you have read            this chapter, you will:            \\x02 know what is meant by a sociotechnical system and understand                the difference between a technical, computer-based system and                 a sociotechnical system;            \\x02 have been introduced to the concept of emergent system                properties, such as reliability, performance, safety, and security;            \\x02 know about the procurement, development, and operational                activities that are involved in the systems engineering process;            \\x02 understand why software dependability and security should not be                considered in isolation and how they are affected by systems                issues, such as operator errors.            Contents            10.1 Complex systems            10.2 Systems engineering            10.3 System procurement            10.4 System development            10.5 System operation281264 Chapter    10 \\x02 Sociotechnical     systems                                   In a computer  system, the software  and the hardware are interdependent.  Without                                   hardware, a software system is  an abstraction, which  is simply  a  representation of                                   some human knowledge and ideas. Without software, hardware is a set of inert elec-                                   tronic  devices. However, if  you  put  them together to  form  a system, you  create a                                   machine that can  carry out  complex computations  and deliver  the results  of these                                   computations to its environment.                                       This  illustrates one of the fundamental characteristics of a system—it is more than                                   the sum of its  parts. Systems have properties that only become apparent when their                                   components are integrated and operate together. Therefore software  engineering is                                   not an isolated activity,  but is an intrinsic  part of  more general systems engineering                                   processes. Software systems are not isolated systems but rather essential components                                   of more extensive systems that have some human, social, or organizational purpose.                                       For  example, the wilderness weather system software controls the instruments in a                                   weather station. It communicates with  other software systems and is a part of wider                                   national and international weather forecasting systems. As well as hardware and soft-                                   ware, these systems include processes for forecasting the weather, people who operate                                   the system and analyze its outputs. The system also includes  the organizations that                                   depend on the system to help them provide weather forecasts to individuals, government,                                   industry, etc. These broader systems are sometimes called sociotechnical systems. They                                   include nontechnical elements such as people, processes, regulations, etc., as well as                                   technical components such as computers, software, and other equipment.                                       Sociotechnical    systems  are  so complex   that  it  is  practically   impossible    to                                   understand them as a whole. Rather, you  have to view them  as layers, as shown in                                   Figure 10.1.  These layers make up the sociotechnical   systems stack:                                   1. The    equipment  layer This   layer  is  composed of  hardware  devices,  some of                                          which may  be computers.                                   2. The    operating system layer This  layer interacts with  the hardware and provides                                          a set of common facilities  for higher software  layers in the system.                                   3. The    communications and data management layer This layer extends the operat-                                          ing system facilities  and provides an interface that allows interaction  with more                                          extensive functionality,   such as access to remote systems, access to a system                                          database, etc. This is sometimes called middleware, as it is in between the appli-                                          cation and the operating system.                                   4. The    application  layer This   layer delivers the  application-specific  functionality                                          that is required. There may be many different application programs in  this layer.                                   5. The    business process layer At this  level, the organizational business processes,                                          which make use of the software system, are defined and enacted.                                   6. The   organizational layer This layer includes higher-level strategic processes as well                                          as business rules, policies, and norms that should be followed when using the system.                                   7. The    social layer At  this layer, the laws and regulations of society that govern the                                          operation of the system are defined.282                                                                                              Chapter 10 \\x02 Sociotechnical     systems 265                                                                                                 Society                                                                                             Organization                                                                                        Business Processes                                                                                         Application System                                            Systems                                                                                         Software                                                                                                                                                 Engineering                                          Engineering            Communications and Data Management                                                                                         Operating SystemFigure 10.1 Thesociotechnical systems                                                         Equipmentstack                                       In  principle,  most  interactions  are between neighboring  layers, with  each layer                                   hiding  the detail  of  the layer  below  from  the layer  above. In  practice,  this is  not                                   always the case. There can be unexpected interactions between layers, which result                                   in problems for  the system as a whole. For example, say there is a change in the law                                   governing access to personal information. This  comes from the social layer. It  leads                                   to new organizational  procedures and changes to the business processes. However,                                   the application  system may not  be able to provide  the required  level of  privacy so                                   changes have to  be implemented   in  the communications   and  data management                                   layer.                                       Thinking   holistically   about systems, rather than simply  considering  software in                                   isolation,   it  is essential  when  considering   software  security  and  dependability.                                   Software failure, in  itself, rarely has serious consequences because software is intan-                                   gible and, even when damaged, is easily and cheaply restored. However, when these                                   software failures ripple  through other  parts of the system, they affect the software’s                                   physical and human environment. Here, the consequences of failure are more signif-                                   icant. People may have to do  extra work  to contain or  recover from  the failure;  for                                   example, there may be physical damage to equipment, data may be lost or corrupted,                                   or confidentiality  may be breached with unknown  consequences.                                       You  must, therefore, take a system-level  view  when you are designing  software                                   that has to be secure and dependable. You need to understand the consequences of                                   software failures for  other elements in the system. You also need to understand how                                   these other system elements may be the cause of software failures and how they can                                   help to protect against and recover from software failures.                                       Therefore,  it  is a system rather  than a software  failure  that is the real  problem.                                   This means that you need to examine how the software interacts with  its immediate                                   environment to ensure that:                                   1. Software    failures are, as far as possible, contained within the enclosing layers of                                          the system stack and do not seriously affect the operation of adjoining layers. In                                          particular, software failures  should not lead to system failures.283266 Chapter    10 \\x02 Sociotechnical     systems                                   2. You    understand how faults and failures in the non-software layers of the systems                                          stack may affect the software.  You may also consider how checks may be built                                          into the software to  help detect these failures, and how support can be provided                                          for recovering  from failure.                                       As  software is  inherently flexible,   unexpected system problems are often left  to                                   software engineers to solve. Say a radar installation has been sited so that ghosting of                                   the radar image occurs. It is impractical to move the radar to a site with less interfer-                                   ence, so the systems engineers have to find another way of removing  this ghosting.                                   Their solution may be to enhance the image-processing capabilities of the software to                                   remove the ghost images. This may slow down  the software so that its performance                                   becomes unacceptable. The problem may then be characterized as a ‘software failure’,                                   whereas, in fact, it is a failure in the design process for the system as a whole.                                       This  sort of  situation,  in which  software  engineers are left  with  the problem  of                                   enhancing software capabilities without  increasing hardware costs, is very common.                                   Many so-called  software failures  are not a consequence of inherent software  prob-                                   lems but rather are the result of trying to  change the software to accommodate mod-                                   ified system engineering requirements. A good example of this was the failure of  the                                   Denver airport baggage system (Swartz, 1996),  where the controlling  software was                                   expected to deal with limitations  of the equipment used.                                       Systems engineering  (Stevens et al.,  1998; Thayer,  2002; Thomé,  1993; White                                    et al., 1993) is the process of designing entire systems—not just the software in these                                   systems. Software is  the controlling   and integrating  element in  these systems and                                   software engineering costs are often the main cost component in  the overall system                                   costs. As a software engineer, it helps if  you have a broader awareness of how soft-                                   ware interacts with  other hardware and software systems, and how it is supposed to                                   be used. This knowledge helps you understand the limits  of software, to design bet-                                   ter software, and to participate in a systems engineering group.                     10.1 Complex                systems                                   The term ‘system’ is one that is universally used. We talk about computer systems, oper-                                   ating systems, payment systems, the education system, the system of government, and so                                   on. These are all obviously quite different uses of the word ‘system’, although they share                                   the characteristic that, somehow, the system is more than simply the sum of its parts.                                       Abstract  systems, such as the system of government, are outside the scope of this                                   book. Rather, I focus on systems that include computers and that have some specific                                   purpose such as to enable communication, support navigation,  or compute salaries.                                   A useful working  definition  of  these types of systems is as follows:                                       A  system is a purposeful  collection   of interrelated   components, of  different                                       kinds,  which work together to achieve some objective.                                       This  general definition  embraces a vast range of systems. For example, a simple                                   system, such as laser pointer, may include a few hardware components plus a small284                                                                                10.1 \\x02 Complex   systems 267amount of control  software. By contrast, an air traffic  control  system includes thou-sands of hardware and software components plus human users who make decisionsbased on information from that computer  system.    A  characteristic of  all complex systems is that the properties and behavior of  thesystem components are  inextricably   intermingled.  The  successful functioning   ofeach system component depends on the functioning of other components. Thus, soft-ware can only operate if  the processor is operational. The processor can only  carryout computations if  the software system defining  these computations has been suc-cessfully installed.    Complex   systems are usually   hierarchical  and  so include  other  systems. Forexample, a police command  and control  system may include  a geographical infor-mation system to provide details of the location of incidents. These included systemsare called ‘subsystems’.  Subsystems can  operate as independent systems in  theirown right.  For example, the same geographical information  system may be used insystems for transport logistics and emergency command and control.    Systems that include software fall  into two  categories:1. Technical    computer-based systems These are systems that include hardware and       software components but not procedures and processes. Examples of technical       systems include televisions,  mobile phones, and other equipment  with  embed-       ded software. Most  software for  PCs, computer games, etc., also falls into  this       category. Individuals  and organizations  use technical  systems for  a particular       purpose but knowledge of  this purpose is not  part of  the system. For example,       the word processor I am using is not aware that is it being used to write a book.2. Sociotechnical    systems These include one or  more technical  systems but, cru-       cially, also include  people who understand the purpose of the system within the       system itself.  Sociotechnical  systems have defined  operational processes and       people (the operators) are inherent  parts of  the system. They are governed  by       organizational  policies  and rules and may  be affected  by external  constraints       such as national laws and regulatory  policies. For  example, this book  was cre-       ated through a sociotechnical publishing system that includes various processes       and technical systems.    Sociotechnical  systems are enterprise systems that are intended to help deliver abusiness goal. This might be to  increase sales, reduce material used in manufactur-ing, collect  taxes, maintain  a safe airspace, etc. Because they are embedded in  anorganizational  environment, the  procurement, development,  and use of  these sys-tems are influenced by the organization’s  policies and procedures, and by its work-ing culture.  The users of the system are people who  are influenced by  the way  theorganization is managed and by their  interactions with  other people inside and out-side of the organization.    When  you are trying  to develop sociotechnical  systems, you need to understandthe organizational environment in which they are used. If you don’t, the systems maynot meet  business  needs and users  and their   managers may  reject  the  system.285268 Chapter    10 \\x02 Sociotechnical     systems                                   Organizational  factors from  the system’s environment  that may  affect the  require-                                   ments, design, and operation of a sociotechnical system include:                                   1. Process    changes The system may require changes to the work processes in the                                          environment. If  so, training will  certainly be required. If  changes are significant,                                          or if  they involve  people losing  their  jobs, there is a danger that the  users will                                          resist the introduction  of the system.                                   2. Job    changes New  systems may de-skill  the  users in an environment  or  cause                                          them  to  change  the  way   they  work.   If  so,  users  may  actively   resist  the                                          introduction  of the system into the organization.  Designs that involve managers                                          having to  change their way of  working  to fit  a new computer  system are often                                          resented. The managers may feel  that their  status in the organization  is  being                                          reduced by the system.                                   3. Organizational     changes The system may change the political power structure in                                          an organization. For example, if an organization is dependent on a complex sys-                                          tem, those who control access to that system have a great deal of political power.                                       Sociotechnical  systems have three characteristics that are particularly  important                                   when considering security and dependability:                                   1. They     have emergent properties  that are properties  of  the system  as a whole,                                          rather than associated with individual   parts of the system. Emergent properties                                          depend on both  the system  components and the  relationships  between them.                                          Given this  complexity,  the emergent properties can only be evaluated once the                                          system has been assembled. Security  and dependability  are emergent system                                          properties.                                   2. They    are often nondeterministic. This means that when presented with a specific                                          input,  they may  not always  produce  the same output.  The system’s behavior                                          depends on the human  operators and people do  not always  react in  the same                                          way. Furthermore, use of the system may  create new relationships between the                                          system components and hence change its emergent behavior. System faults and                                          failures may  therefore be transient, and people may  disagree about whether or                                          not a failure has actually occurred.                                   3. The    extent to which  the system supports organizational objectives does not just                                          depend on the system itself. It  also depends on the stability of these objectives,                                          the relationships, and conflicts  between organizational objectives and how peo-                                          ple in the organization interpret these objectives. New management may reinter-                                          pret the organizational  objectives that a system was designed to support so that                                          a ‘successful’ system may then be seen as a ‘failure’.                                       Sociotechnical  considerations are often  critical  in  determining  whether or not  a                                   system has successfully met its objectives. Unfortunately,  taking  these into account                                   is very difficult  for  engineers who have little experience of social or cultural  studies.286                                                                                                                   10.1 \\x02 Complex    systems 269    Property                Description    Volume                 The volume of a system (the total space occupied) varies depending on how the                                  component assemblies are arranged and connected.    Reliability              System reliability depends on component reliability but unexpected interactions can cause                                  new types of\""

extremely complex difficult to understand and expensive to change                                        there are many different types of  software systems from simple  embedded sys                                   tems to complex worldwide  information systems it is pointless to look for  universal                                   notations methods or  techniques for software  engineering because different types                                   of software  require different  approaches developing an organizational information                                   system is completely  different  from  developing  a controller  for  a scientific  instru                                   ment neither of these systems has much in common with a graphicsintensive com                                   puter game all of these applications need software engineering they do not all need                                   the same software engineering techniques                                        there are still many reports of software projects going wrong and software failures                                   software engineering is  criticized  as inadequate for modern software development                                   however in my view many of  these socalled software failures are a consequence of                                   two factors                                   1 increasing     demands as new software  engineering techniques help  us to build                                          larger more  complex systems the demands change systems have to be  built                                          and delivered  more quickly   larger even more complex  systems are required                                          systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impos                                          sible  existing  software  engineering  methods cannot  cope and new  software                                          engineering techniques have to be developed to meet new these new demands                                   2 low    expectations it is relatively  easy to write computer programs without  using                                          software  engineering methods  and techniques many  companies  have drifted                                          into software development as their products and services have evolved they do                                          not use software  engineering  methods in  their everyday  work  consequently                                          their  software is  often more expensive and  less reliable than it  should  be we                                          need better software engineering education and training to address this problem                                        software engineers can be rightly proud of their  achievements of course we still                                   have problems developing complex  software but without  software engineering  we                                   would not have explored space would not have the internet or modern telecommuni

development 5              history of software engineeringthe notion of software engineering was first proposed in 1968 at a conference held to discuss what was thencalled the software crisis naur and randell 1969 it became clear that individual approaches to programdevelopment did not scale up to large and complex software systems these were unreliable cost more thanexpected and were delivered late   throughout the 1970s and 1980s a variety of new software engineering techniques and methods weredeveloped such as structured programming information hiding and objectoriented development tools andstandard notations were developed and are now extensively used                                      httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebhistory                   11 professional

      however the vast majority of  software development is a professional activity  where                              software is developed for  specific business purposes for inclusion in  other devices                              or as software products such as information systems cad systems etc professional                              software intended for use by someone apart from its

 intended to support professional  software development                              rather than  individual  programming   it  includes techniques  that support  program

computer programs                              however when we  are talking  about software engineering software  is not just  the                              programs themselves but also all  associated documentation and configuration  data                              that is required  to make  these programs operate correctly a  professionally  devel                              oped software system is often more than a single program the system usually  con                              sists of a number of separate programs and configuration files that are used to set up                              these programs it may include system documentation which describes the structure                              of the system user documentation which explains how  to use the system

accounting systems or  systems for                   maintaining  dental records            2 customized    or bespoke products these are systems that are commissioned by                   a particular  customer a  software  contractor  develops the software  especially                   for  that customer examples of this type of software include  control systems for                   electronic  devices systems written to support a particular business process and                   air traffic  control  systems                 an important difference between these types of software is that in generic products            the organization that develops the software controls the software specification for cus            tom products the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization            that is buying the software the software developers must work to that specification                 however  the  distinction    between  these system  product   types  is  becoming            increasingly  blurred  more  and  more systems are now  being built   with  a generic            product  as a base which  is then  adapted to  suit the  requirements of  a customer            enterprise resource planning erp  systems such as the sap system are the best            examples of this  approach here a large and complex system is adapted for a com            pany  by  incorporating   information   about  business  rules and  processes reports            required and so on                 when we  talk  about the quality  of  professional  software  we have to  take into            account that the software  is used and changed by people apart from  its developers            quality  is therefore not just concerned with what  the software does rather it has to            include the softwares behavior while it is executing and the structure and organization            of  the system programs and associated documentation this is reflected in socalled            quality or nonfunctional  software attributes examples of these attributes are the soft            wares response time to a user query and the understandability of the program code                 the specific set of attributes  that you might expect from  a software system obvi            ously  depends on its application  therefore  a banking  system must be secure an            interactive game must be responsive a telephone switching system must be reliable            and so on these can be generalized into  the set of  attributes shown in  figure 12            which  i believe are the essential characteristics of a professional software system111 software        engineering            software engineering is an

must work  tosoftware                            organizational  and financial  constraints so they look  for  solutions within  these                                          constraints

development it also includes activities                                          such as software project  management and the development of  tools methods                                          and theories to support software production                                        engineering is  about getting  results of the  required quality  within   the schedule                                   and budget this often involves  making compromises—engineers cannot be perfec                                   tionists people writing  programs for  themselves however can spend as much time                                   as they wish on the program development                                        in general software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their                                   work  as this  is  often  the most  effective  way  to  produce  highquality   software                                   however engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for  a set of                                   circumstances  so a more  creative  less formal  approach  to development  may  be                                   effective in  some circumstances less formal development is  particularly  appropri                                   ate for the  development of webbased systems which  requires a blend of  software                                   and graphical design skills                                        software engineering is important for  two reasons                                   1 more    and more individuals  and society rely on advanced software systems we                                          need to be able to  produce reliable and trustworthy   systems economically and                                          quickly26                                                        11 \\x02 professional     software development 92 it    is  usually cheaper in the long  run to use software engineering methods and       techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a       personal programming project for  most types of systems the majority of costs       are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use    the systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes calleda software process a software  process is a sequence of activities  that leads to  theproduction of a software product there are four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes these activities are1 software    specification  where customers and engineers define the software that       is to be produced and the constraints on its operation2 software    development where the software is designed and programmed3 software    validation  where the software is checked to ensure that it  is what the       customer requires4 software    evolution where the software is modified to reflect  changing customer       and market requirements    different   types of  systems need different development  processes for examplerealtime software in  an aircraft has to be completely  specified before  developmentbegins in ecommerce systems the specification and the program are usually developed together consequently these generic activities may be organized  in differentways and described at different  levels  of detail  depending on  the type of  softwarebeing developed i describe software processes in more detail in chapter 2    software engineering is related to both computer science and systems engineering1 computer    science is concerned with the theories and methods that underlie com       puters and software systems whereas software engineering is concerned with the       practical problems of producing software some knowledge of computer science       is essential  for software  engineers  in the  same way that  some knowledge  of       physics is essential for electrical engineers computer science theory however is       often most applicable to relatively small  programs elegant theories of computer       science cannot always be applied to large complex problems that require a soft       ware solution2 system    engineering is concerned with  all  aspects of the development and evo       lution of  complex systems where software plays a major role system engineer       ing  is therefore  concerned  with  hardware  development   policy  and process       design and system deployment as well  as software engineering  system engi       neers are involved  in specifying   the system defining   its overall  architecture       and then integrating  the different  parts to create the finished  system they are       less concerned  with  the  engineering  of  the  system components  hardware       software etc2710 chapter    1 \\x02 introduction                                   as i discuss in the next section there are many different types of software there is no                                   universal software engineering method or technique that is applicable for all of these                                   however there are three general issues that affect many different types of software                                   1 heterogeneity increasingly   systems are required to operate as distributed systems                                          across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices as                                          well as running on generalpurpose computers software may also have to execute                                          on mobile phones you often have to integrate new software with older legacy sys                                          tems written in different programming languages the challenge here is to develop                                          techniques for building dependable software that is flexible enough to cope with                                          this heterogeneity                                   2 business   and social change business and society are changing incredibly quickly                                          as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available they                                          need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new soft                                          ware many traditional  software engineering techniques are time consuming and                                          delivery of  new systems often takes longer than planned they need to evolve so                                          that the time required for software to deliver value to its customers is reduced                                   3 security    and trust as  software  is intertwined  with  all  aspects of our lives it  is                                          essential that we can trust that software this  is especially true for  remote soft                                          ware systems accessed through a web page or web service interface we have to                                          make sure that malicious users cannot attack our software and that  information                                          security is maintained                                        of course these are not independent issues for example it may be necessary to                                   make rapid changes to a legacy system to provide it with a web service interface to                                   address these challenges we will need new tools and techniques as well as innovative                                   ways of combining  and using existing software engineering methods                      112 software         engineering      diversity                                   software  engineering is  a systematic approach  to the production   of software  that                                   takes into account practical  cost schedule and dependability  issues as well as the                                   needs of software customers and producers how  this systematic approach is  actu                                   ally implemented  varies dramatically  depending on the organization developing  the                                   software the type of  software and the people involved in  the development process                                   there are no universal  software engineering  methods and techniques that are suit                                   able for all  systems and all companies rather a diverse set of software engineering                                   methods and tools has evolved over the past 50 years                                        perhaps the most significant  factor  in  determining  which  software engineering                                   methods and techniques are most important  is the type  of application  that is  being                                   developed there are many different types of application including                                   1 standalone    applications these are application systems that run on a local com                                          puter such as a pc they include all necessary functionality and do not need to28

manipulation  software etc2 interactive     transactionbased applications these  are applications  that execute       on a remote  computer and  that are accessed by users from  their  own  pcs or       terminals obviously these include web applications such as ecommerce appli       cations where you can interact with  a remote system to buy goods and services       this  class of  application   also includes   business systems  where a  business       provides access to its systems through a web browser or specialpurpose client       program and cloudbased services such as mail and photo  sharing interactive       applications often incorporate  a large data store that is accessed and updated in       each transaction3 embedded   control  systems these are software control systems that control and       manage hardware devices numerically there are probably more embedded sys       tems than any other type of system examples of embedded systems include the       software in  a mobile cell  phone software that controls  antilock  braking  in a       car and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking  process4 batch     processing  systems these are  business systems that  are  designed to       process data in large batches they process large numbers of individual inputs to       create corresponding   outputs  examples  of  batch  systems include  periodic       billing  systems such as phone billing systems and salary payment systems5 entertainment    systems these are systems that are primarily for personal use and       which are intended to entertain the user most of these systems are games of one       kind or another the quality of  the user interaction offered is the most important       distinguishing  characteristic of entertainment systems6 systems   for  modeling and simulation these  are systems that are developed by       scientists  and  engineers  to  model  physical   processes or  situations   which       include  many separate interacting  objects  these are often  computationally       intensive and require highperformance parallel systems for execution7 data    collection  systems these are systems that collect data from their environ       ment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing       the software has to interact with sensors and often is installed in a hostile envi       ronment such as inside an engine or in a remote location8 systems   of systems these are systems that are composed of a number of other       software systems some of  these may be generic software products  such as a       spreadsheet program other systems in the assembly may  be specially written       for that environment    of  course the boundaries between these system types are blurred if you developa game for a mobile cell phone you have to take into account the same constraintspower hardware interaction  as the developers of  the phone software  batch processing systems are often used in conjunction with webbased systems for example2912 chapter    1 \\x02 introduction                                   in a company travel expense claims may be submitted through a web application but                                   processed in a batch application for monthly  payment                                        you use  different   software  engineering   techniques  for  each  type  of  system                                   because the software has quite different characteristics for  example an embedded                                   control  system in  an automobile  is  safetycritical   and is  burned into  rom  when                                   installed in the vehicle it is therefore very  expensive to change such a system needs                                   very extensive verification  and validation so that the chances of having to recall cars                                   after sale to  fix  software problems  are minimized  user interaction  is  minimal  or                                   perhaps nonexistent so there is no need to use a development process that relies on                                   user interface prototyping                                        for a webbased system an approach based on iterative development and delivery                                   may be  appropriate  with   the system  being  composed of  reusable  components                                   however  such an approach  may be  impractical   for  a system of  systems where                                   detailed specifications of  the system interactions have to be specified in  advance so                                   that each system can be separately developed                                        nevertheless there are software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types                                   of software system                                   1 they     should  be  developed  using  a managed  and  understood  development                                          process the organization developing the software should plan the development                                          process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will  be com                                          pleted of course different  processes are used for different types of software                                   2 dependability     and performance are important for all types of systems software                                          should  behave as expected without   failures  and should  be available  for  use                                          when it  is  required it  should  be safe in  its operation  and as far  as possible                                          should be secure against external attack the system should perform efficiently                                          and should not waste resources                                   3 understanding    and managing the software specification and requirements what                                          the software should do are important you have to know what different customers                                          and users of the system expect from it and you have to manage their expectations                                          so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule                                   4 you    should make as effective use as possible of existing resources this means                                          that where appropriate you should  reuse software that has already been devel                                          oped rather than write new software                                        these fundamental notions of process dependability requirements management                                   and reuse are important themes of this book  different  methods reflect them in  dif                                   ferent ways but they underlie all  professional software development                                        you should notice that these fundamentals do not cover implementation and pro                                   gramming i dont  cover specific programming techniques in this book because these                                   vary dramatically  from  one type of system to another for example a scripting  lan                                   guage such as ruby is used for webbased system programming but would be com                                   pletely inappropriate  for embedded systems engineering30                                                                   11 \\x02 professional    software  development 13113 software

accessible information store and             it had little   effect on software  systems these systems ran on local computers  and             were only accessible from within   an organization around  2000 the web started to             evolve and more  and more functionality    was added to  browsers this  meant that             webbased systems could  be developed where  instead of  a specialpurpose  user             interface  these systems could  be accessed using a web  browser  this  led to  the             development of a vast range of new system products that delivered innovative  serv             ices accessed over the web these are often funded by adverts that are displayed on             the users screen and do not involve direct payment from users                 as  well  as these system products the development of  web browsers  that could             run small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and             organizational software instead of writing   software and deploying it  on users pcs             the software was deployed  on a web server this  made it much  cheaper to change             and upgrade the software as there was no need to install the software on every pc it             also  reduced  costs  as  user  interface   development   is  particularly    expensive             consequently wherever it has been possible to do so many businesses have moved             to webbased interaction with company software systems                 the  next stage in the development of  webbased systems was the notion of web             services web services are software components that deliver specific useful function             ality and which are accessed over the web applications are constructed by integrating             these web services which may be provided by different companies in principle this             linking can be dynamic so that an application may use different web services each time             that it is executed i cover this approach to software development in chapter 19                 in  the last few years the notion of  software  as a service has been developed it             has been proposed that software will  not normally   run on local  computers but will             run on computing  clouds  that  are accessed over the internet if you  use a service             such as webbased mail you are using a cloudbased system a computing cloud is             a huge number of linked  computer systems that is  shared by many users users do             not buy software  but pay according to  how much  the software is used or  are given             free access in return for watching adverts that are displayed on their screen                 the  advent of the web therefore has led to  a significant  change in the way that             business software is organized before  the web business applications were  mostly             monolithic   single  programs  running  on single  computers  or  computer  clusters             communications were local within  an organization now software is highly  distrib             uted sometimes across the world business applications  are not programmed from             scratch but involve extensive reuse of components and programs                 this  radical change in software organization has obviously led to changes in the             ways that webbased systems are engineered for example             1 software    reuse has become the dominant approach for constructing  webbased                    systems when building  these systems you think about how you  can assemble                    them from preexisting  software components and systems3114

ments for  such systems in  advance webbased systems should be developed                                          and delivered incrementally                                   3 user    interfaces are constrained  by the capabilities  of  web browsers although                                          technologies such as ajax  holdener  2008 mean that  rich interfaces can be                                          created within  a web browser these technologies are still  difficult   to use web                                          forms with  local  scripting  are more commonly  used application  interfaces on                                          webbased systems are often poorer than the specially designed user interfaces                                          on pc system products                                        the fundamental ideas of software engineering discussed in the previous section                                   apply to webbased software in  the same way that they apply to other types of  soft                                   ware system experience gained with large system development in  the 20th century                                   is still  relevant to webbased software                       12 software                 engineering               ethics                                   like  other  engineering  disciplines   software  engineering  is carried  out  within   a                                   social and legal framework that limits  the freedom of people working in that area as                                   a software engineer you  must accept that  your job  involves  wider responsibilities                                   than simply  the application  of  technical skills  you  must also behave in an ethical                                   and morally responsible way if  you are to be respected as a professional engineer                                        it goes without  saying that  you should  uphold normal  standards of honesty and                                   integrity you should not use your skills  and abilities to behave in a dishonest way or                                   in a way  that will  bring  disrepute to the software engineering  profession however                                   there are areas where standards of acceptable behavior are not bound by laws but by                                   the more tenuous notion of professional responsibility  some of these are                                   1 confidentiality you     should normally  respect the confidentiality of  your employ                                          ers or clients  irrespective of whether  or not a formal  confidentiality   agreement                                          has been signed                                   2 competence you   should not misrepresent your level of competence you should                                          not knowingly  accept work that is outside your  competence                                   3 intellectual     property rights you  should be aware of local laws governing the use                                          of intellectual  property  such as patents and copyright you should be careful to                                          ensure that the intellectual property of  employers and clients is protected                                   4 computer     misuse you  should  not  use your  technical  skills   to  misuse other                                          peoples computers computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial game playing                                          on an employers machine say to extremely serious dissemination of viruses or                                          other malware32                                                                                                      12 \\x02 software    engineering  ethics 15    software engineering code of ethics

ethical dilemmas for example if  you disagree in princi                                   ple with  the policies  of more senior management in  the company how should you                                   react clearly this  depends on the particular individuals   and the nature of the  dis                                   agreement is it best to argue a case for your position from within the organization or                                   to resign  in principle  if  you  feel that  there are problems with  a software  project                                   when do you reveal these to management if you discuss these while they are just a                                   suspicion you may  be overreacting to a situation if  you  leave it too late it  may be

       most cases they are either relatively minor or can be resolved without  too much dif                                   ficulty  where they cannot be resolved the engineer is faced with  perhaps another                                   problem  the principled  action  may be to  resign from  their  job  but this may  well                                   affect others such as their partner or their children                                        a particularly    difficult   situation   for  professional  engineers arises  when their                                   employer acts in  an unethical way  say a company is responsible  for developing  a                                   safetycritical  system and because of  time pressure falsifies  the safety  validation                                   records is  the engineers responsibility   to  maintain confidentiality    or to  alert the                                   customer or publicize in  some way that the delivered system may be unsafe                                        the problem here is that there are no absolutes when it comes to safety although                                   the system may not have been validated according to predefined criteria these crite                                   ria may be too strict the system may actually operate safely throughout its lifetime                                   it is also the case that even when properly validated the system may fail  and cause                                   an accident early disclosure of problems may result in  damage to the employer and                                   other employees failure to disclose problems may result in  damage to others34                                                                                                       13 \\x02 case   studies 17                you must make up your own mind in  these matters the appropriate ethical posi           tion here depends entirely on  the views of  the individuals  who are involved  in this           case the potential for damage the extent of the damage and the people affected by           the damage should influence the decision if  the situation  is very dangerous it may           be justified   to  publicize  it  using  the  national  press say  however  you  should           always try to resolve the situation  while respecting the rights of  your employer                another ethical  issue is participation  in the development of  military  and nuclear           systems some people feel strongly about these issues and do not wish to participate in           any systems development associated with military systems others will work on mili           tary systems but not on weapons systems yet others feel that national security is an           overriding principle and have no ethical objections to working on weapons systems                in this situation  it is  important that both  employers and employees should make           their views  known  to each other in  advance where an organization  is involved  in           military  or nuclear work they should be able to specify that employees must be will           ing to  accept any work assignment equally  if  an employee is taken on and makes           clear that they do not wish to work  on such systems employers should not put pres           sure on them to do so at some later date                the general  area of  ethics  and professional  responsibility    is becoming  more           important as softwareintensive systems pervade every aspect of work and everyday           life  it can be considered from a philosophical  standpoint where the basic principles           of ethics are considered and software engineering ethics are discussed with reference           to these basic principles this is the approach taken by laudon 1995 and to a lesser           extent by  huff  and martin   1995 johnsons  text on computer  ethics 2001  also           approaches the topic from a philosophical perspective                however i  find  that this  philosophical  approach is too  abstract and difficult   to           relate to everyday experience i prefer the more concrete approach embodied in codes           of conduct and practice i think  that ethics are best discussed in a software engineer           ing context  and not as a subject in their  own right  in  this book therefore  i do not           include abstract ethical discussions but where appropriate  include examples in the           exercises that can be the starting point for a group discussion on ethical issues13 case           studies           to illustrate   software  engineering  concepts i  use examples from  three  different           types of systems throughout the book the reason why i have not used a single case           study is that one of the key messages in this book is that software engineering prac           tice depends on the type of systems being produced i therefore choose an appropri           ate example  when discussing  concepts such  as safety and  dependability  system           modeling reuse etc                the three types of systems that i use as case studies are           1 an    embedded system this is a system where  the software controls  a hardware                  device and is  embedded in that  device issues in  embedded systems typically3518 chapter    1 \\x02 introduction                                          include physical size responsiveness power management etc the example of an                                          embedded system that i use is a software system to control a medical device                                   2 an    information   system this is  a system whose primary  purpose is  to manage                                          and provide access to a database of information  issues in information  systems                                          include security usability  privacy and maintaining  data integrity the example                                          of an information  system that i use is a medical records system                                   3 a    sensorbased data collection system this is a system whose primary  purpose                                          is to  collect data from  a set of sensors and process that data in some way the                                          key requirements of  such systems are reliability  even in hostile  environmental                                          conditions  and maintainability   the example  of a data collection   system that                                          i use is a wilderness weather station                                        i introduce  each of  these systems in this chapter  with  more information   about                                   each of them available on the web                      131 an      insulin    pump    control     system                                   an insulin  pump is a medical system that simulates the operation of the pancreas an                                   internal organ the software controlling   this system is an embedded system which                                   collects information   from  a sensor and controls  a pump  that delivers  a controlled                                   dose of insulin to a user                                        people who suffer from diabetes use the system diabetes is a relatively common                                   condition  where the human pancreas is unable to produce sufficient  quantities  of a                                   hormone called insulin  insulin  metabolises glucose sugar in  the blood  the con                                   ventional treatment of  diabetes involves regular injections of genetically  engineered                                   insulin diabetics  measure their blood sugar levels using an external meter and then                                   calculate the dose of insulin that they should inject                                        the problem with  this treatment is that the level  of insulin  required does not just                                   depend on the blood glucose level  but also on the time  of the last  insulin injection                                   this can lead to very low levels of blood glucose if there is too much insulin or very                                   high levels of blood  sugar if there is too  little insulin  low  blood glucose is in  the                                   short term a more serious condition as it can result in temporary brain malfunctioning                                   and ultimately unconsciousness and death in the long term however continual high                                   levels of blood glucose can lead to eye damage kidney damage and heart problems                                        current advances in developing miniaturized sensors have meant that it is now pos                                   sible to develop automated insulin delivery systems these systems monitor blood sugar                                   levels and deliver an appropriate dose of insulin when required insulin delivery systems                                   like this already exist for the treatment of hospital patients in the future it may be pos                                   sible for many diabetics to have such systems permanently attached to their bodies                                        a softwarecontrolled    insulin   delivery  system might   work  by using  a micro                                   sensor embedded in the patient to measure some blood parameter that is proportional                                   to the sugar level this is then sent to the pump controller  this controller  computes                                   the sugar level and  the amount of  insulin  that is needed it  then sends signals to a                                   miniaturized  pump to deliver the insulin  via a permanently attached needle36

and organization   of  the  insulinfigure 15 activitymodel of the insulin pump    to  understand the examples in  this  book all  you  need to know  is that  thepump                          blood  sensor measures  the electrical   conductivity    of  the blood  under  different                                   conditions   and  that these  values  can be  related  to  the  blood  sugar  level  the                                   insulin  pump delivers  one unit of  insulin  in response to a single  pulse from  a con                                   troller  therefore  to deliver  10 units  of  insulin  the controller   sends 10 pulses to                                   the pump  figure  15 is  a uml   activity   model  that illustrates   how the  software                                   transforms  an input  blood  sugar level  to a  sequence of commands  that drive  the                                   insulin  pump                                        clearly this  is a safetycritical  system if  the  pump fails  to operate or  does not                                   operate correctly  then the  users health  may be damaged or  they may  fall  into  a                                   coma because their blood sugar levels are too high or too  low there are therefore                                   two essential highlevel requirements that this system must meet                                   1 the    system shall be available to deliver insulin  when required                                   2 the    system shall  perform reliably  and deliver  the correct  amount of insulin  to                                          counteract the current level of blood  sugar3720 chapter    1 \\x02 introduction

connectivity when the local sys                                   tems have secure network access they use patient information in the database but they                                   can download

organization of the mhcpms                                        the mhcpms  has two overall goals                                   1 to    generate management information   that  allows health  service  managers to                                          assess performance against local and government targets                                   2 to    provide  medical  staff  with  timely  information   to support  the treatment  of                                          patients38                                                                                            13 \\x02 case   studies 21    the nature of  mental health problems is such that patients are often disorganizedso may miss appointments deliberately or  accidentally lose prescriptions  and medication forget instructions  and make unreasonable demands on medical staff theymay drop in on clinics  unexpectedly in a minority  of cases they may be a danger tothemselves or to other people they may regularly change address or may be homeless on a longterm or shortterm basis where patients are dangerous they may needto be sectioned—confined  to a secure hospital for treatment and observation    users of the system include clinical  staff  such as doctors nurses and health visitors nurses who visit people at home to check on their treatment nonmedical usersinclude receptionists  who make appointments  medical records staff  who maintainthe records system and administrative staff who generate reports    the system is used to record information about patients name address age nextof kin  etc consultations date doctor  seen subjective impressions of the patientetc conditions and treatments reports are generated at regular intervals for medical staff and health authority managers typically reports for medical  staff focus oninformation  about individual  patients whereas management reports are anonymizedand are concerned with conditions costs of treatment etc    the key features of the system are1 individual     care management clinicians  can create records for patients edit the       information  in  the system view  patient history  etc the system supports data       summaries so that doctors  who have not previously  met  a patient can quickly       learn about the key problems and treatments that have been prescribed2 patient    monitoring the   system regularly  monitors  the records of  patients that       are involved in treatment and issues warnings if possible problems are detected       therefore if  a patient has not  seen a doctor for some time  a warning  may be       issued one of the most important elements of the monitoring  system is to keep       track of patients who have been sectioned and to ensure that the legally required       checks are carried out at the right time3 administrative     reporting the   system generates monthly  management  reports       showing the  number of  patients treated at each clinic   the number of  patients       who have entered and  left  the care system number  of patients  sectioned the       drugs prescribed and their costs etc    two different  laws affect the system these are laws on data protection that governthe confidentiality of personal information and mental health laws that govern the compulsory detention of patients deemed to be a danger to themselves or others mentalhealth is unique in this respect as it is the only medical speciality that can recommendthe detention of patients against their will this is subject to very strict legislative safeguards one of the aims of the mhcpms  is to ensure that staff always act in accordance with the law and that their decisions are recorded for judicial review if necessary    as in all  medical systems privacy is a critical system requirement it is essential thatpatient information is confidential and is never disclosed to anyone apart from authorized medical staff and the patient themselves the mhcpms is also a safetycritical3922 chapter

patients                                   there is a potential conflict  here—privacy is easiest to maintain when there is only a                                   single copy of the system data however to ensure availability in  the event of server                                   failure or  when disconnected from a network  multiple  copies of the data should be                                   maintained i discuss the tradeoffs between these requirements in later chapters                     133 a      wilderness      weather     station                                   to help monitor climate  change and to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts in                                   remote areas the government of a country with  large areas of wilderness decides to                                   deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas these weather stations col                                   lect data from a set of instruments that measure

have identified  the separate systems using  theuml  stereotype «system» the associations between the packages indicate there isan exchange of information but  at this stage there is no need to define them in anymore detail    each  weather station  includes  a number  of  instruments  that measure weatherparameters such as the wind speed and direction the  ground and air  temperaturesthe barometric pressure and the rainfall over a 24hour period each of these instruments is controlled by  a software system that takes parameter readings periodicallyand manages the data collected from the instruments    the  weather station system  operates by collecting  weather observations  at frequent intervals—for  example  temperatures are measured every minute  howeverbecause the bandwidth to the satellite is relatively narrow the weather station carriesout some local processing and aggregation of  the data it then transmits this  aggregated data when requested by the data collection system if for whatever reason it isimpossible to make a connection then the weather station maintains the data locallyuntil communication  can be resumed    each weather station is batterypowered and must be entirely selfcontained—thereare no external power or network cables available all communications are through a relatively slowspeed satellite link and the weather station must include some mechanismsolar or wind power to charge its batteries as they are deployed in wilderness areasthey are exposed to severe environmental conditions and may be damaged by animalsthe station software is therefore not just concerned with data collection it must also1 monitor     the instruments power and communication hardware and report faults       to the management system2 manage    the  system power ensuring  that  batteries are charged  whenever the       environmental   conditions  permit   but also  that  generators are  shut down  in       potentially  damaging weather conditions such as high wind3 allow      for dynamic   reconfiguration  where  parts of  the software  are replaced       with  new versions and where backup instruments are switched  into the system       in the event of system failure    because weather stations  have to be selfcontained  and unattended this  meansthat the software installed is  complex even though the data collection  functionalityis fairly

the development of software from scratch                                   in a standard programming language like  java or c however business applications                                   are not

                         that are fundamental to software engineering                                   1 software    specification the  functionality   of  the software and constraints  on its                                          operation must be defined                                   2 software     design and  implementation the   software  to meet  the specification                                          must be produced                                   3 software    validation the  software  must be validated to ensure that it  does what                                          the customer wants                                   4 software    evolution the software must evolve to meet changing customer needs                                        in some form  these activities  are part of  all  software processes in practice  of                                   course they are complex activities  in themselves and include subactivities  such as                                   requirements validation architectural design unit testing etc there are also support                                   ing process activities such as documentation and software configuration management                                        when we describe and discuss processes we usually talk  about the activities  in                                   these processes such as specifying a data model designing a user interface etc and                                   the ordering of  these activities however  as well as activities  process descriptions                                   may also include                                   1 products    which  are the outcomes of  a process activity  for example  the out                                          come of  the activity   of  architectural  design  may be a model  of  the software                                          architecture                                   2 roles    which  reflect  the responsibilities  of  the people involved  in the process                                          examples of roles are project manager configuration manager programmer etc                                   3 pre    and postconditions  which  are statements that are true before and after a                                          process activity  has been enacted or a product  produced for example before                                          architectural  design begins a precondition  may be that  all requirements  have                                          been approved by the customer  after this activity   is finished a  postcondition                                          might be that the uml  models describing  the architecture have been reviewed                                        software processes are complex and like all  intellectual  and creative processes                                   rely on people making  decisions and judgments there is no ideal process and most                                   organizations have developed their own software development processes processes                                   have evolved to take advantage of  the capabilities of  the people in  an organization                                   and the specific  characteristics of  the systems that are being  developed for some46

business systems with  rapidly   changing requirements  a less formal  flexible           process is likely to  be more effective                sometimes  software  processes are categorized  as either plandriven   or  agile           processes plandriven processes are processes where all of the process activities are           planned in  advance and progress is measured against this plan in  agile  processes           which  i discuss in  chapter 3 planning is  incremental and it  is easier to change the           process to reflect  changing  customer requirements  as boehm  and turner 2003           discuss each approach is  suitable  for  different  types of  software  generally  you           need to find a balance between plandriven and agile processes                although  there is  no ideal   software process there is  scope for improving   the           software process in many organizations processes may include outdated techniques           or may  not take  advantage of the best practice  in  industrial  software engineering           indeed  many organizations   still  do  not take  advantage of  software  engineering           methods in their software development                software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diver           sity in  software processes across an organization is reduced this leads to improved           communication  and a reduction in training  time and makes automated process sup           port more economical  standardization is also an important  first step in  introducing           new software  engineering methods and techniques  and good software engineering           practice i discuss software process improvement in more detail in  chapter 2621 software                process          models           as i  explained in chapter 1 a software process model is a simplified  representation           of a software process each process model represents a process from a particular per           spective and thus provides only partial information  about that process for example           a process activity  model shows the activities  and their  sequence but may not show           the roles of the people involved in these activities in  this section i introduce a num           ber of  very  general process  models sometimes  called  process paradigms   and           present these from an architectural perspective that is we see the framework of the           process but not the details of specific activities                these generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes rather           they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to           software  development you can think  of  them as process frameworks  that may  be           extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes                the process models that i cover here are           1 the    waterfall  model this  takes the fundamental process activities of  specifica                  tion  development  validation  and evolution   and represents them as separate                  process

directly reflect  the fundamental development activities1 requirements    analysis  and definition the   systems services  constraints and       goals are established by consultation with  system users they are then defined       in detail and serve as a system specification2 system   and software  design the systems design process allocates the require       ments to either hardware or software systems by establishing an overall  system       architecture software design involves identifying  and describing the fundamen       tal software system abstractions and their relationships3 implementation    and  unit testing during   this stage the software design is  real       ized as a set of programs or program  units unit  testing involves verifying   that       each unit meets its specification4 integration      and  system testing the    individual   program   units  or  programs       are integrated  and tested  as a complete   system to  ensure that  the  software       requirements have been met after  testing the software  system is delivered  to       the customer5 operation     and maintenance normally    although  not  necessarily  this is  the       longest  life  cycle  phase the  system is  installed  and put  into  practical  use       maintenance  involves correcting   errors which  were  not discovered  in earlier       stages of  the life  cycle  improving    the implementation   of  system  units and       enhancing the systems services as new requirements are discovered    in  principle  the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approvedsigned off   the following  phase should not start until the previous phase has finished in practice  these stages overlap and feed information  to each other duringdesign problems with  requirements are identified during  coding  design problemsare found and so on the software process is not a simple linear model but  involvesfeedback from one phase to another documents produced in  each phase may thenhave to be modified to reflect the changes made    because of  the costs of  producing  and approving  documents iterations  can becostly and involve significant  rework  therefore after a small  number of iterationsit is normal to freeze parts of the development such as the specification and to continue  with  the  later  development  stages problems  are  left  for  later  resolutionignored or programmed around this premature freezing of requirements may meanthat the system wont  do what  the user wants it  may also lead to  badly structuredsystems as design problems are circumvented by implementation tricks    during  the final  life  cycle phase operation and maintenance the software is putinto use errors and omissions in the original  software requirements are discoveredprogram and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality   is identifiedthe system must therefore evolve to remain useful making these changes softwaremaintenance may involve

                            in  principle  the waterfall  model should only  be used when the requirements are                                   well  understood  and  unlikely   to  change  radically   during  system  development                                   however the waterfall  model reflects the type  of process used in other engineering                                   projects as  is

         an  important variant of  the waterfall model is formal  system development where                                   a mathematical   model  of  a system  specification   is created  this  model  is  then                                   refined using mathematical  transformations that  preserve its consistency into exe                                   cutable code based on the assumption that your  mathematical transformations  are                                   correct you can therefore make a strong  argument that a program generated in this

cause of the     difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and there     may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process        sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons—for example there may be procedures to ensure     that the software properly implements external regulations eg in the united states the sarbanesoxley     accounting regulations changing these procedures may not be possible so process conflicts may be     unavoidable

     the problems of  incremental  development become particularly   acute for  large                                   complex longlifetime  systems where different  teams develop different parts of

of  the system need to be clearly defined                                   with respect to that architecture this has to be planned in advance rather than devel                                   oped incrementally                                        you can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment                                   without   actually  delivering   it  and  deploying   it  in   the customers   environment                                   incremental delivery and deployment  means that the software is used in real opera

    in the majority of  software projects there is some software reuse this often happens                                   informally   when people  working  on the  project  know of  designs or  code that are                                   similar  to what is required they  look for  these modify  them as needed and incor                                   porate them into their system                                       this  informal   reuse takes place irrespective of  the development  process that is                                   used however in the 21st century software development processes that focus on the                                   reuse of existing software have become widely used reuseoriented approaches rely                                   on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating  framework  for                                   the composition of  these components sometimes these components are systems in                                   their own  right cots  or commercial  offtheshelf  systems that may provide  spe                                   cific  functionality  such as word processing or a spreadsheet                                       a  general  process model for  reusebased development is shown  in  figure 23                                   although  the  initial  requirements  specification  stage and the  validation  stage are                                   comparable  with   other  software  processes the  intermediate   stages in  a reuse                                   oriented process are different these stages are                                   1 component    analysis given the requirements specification  a search is made for                                          components to implement that specification usually there is no exact match and                                          the components that may be used only provide some of the functionality required                                   2 requirements   modification during this stage the requirements are analyzed using                                          information about the components that have been discovered they are then mod                                          ified to reflect the available components where modifications are impossible the                                          component analysis activity may be reentered to search for alternative solutions                                   3 system    design with  reuse during  this  phase the framework   of the  system is                                          designed or an existing framework is reused the designers take into account the                                          components that are reused and organize the framework to cater for this  some                                          new software may have to be designed if reusable components are not available                                   4 development     and integration software    that cannot be  externally  procured  is                                          developed and the components and cots systems are integrated to create the                                          new system system integration in  this model may be part of  the development                                          process rather than a separate

                             reuseoriented software engineering has the obvious  advantage of reducing the                                   amount of  software to be developed and so reducing  cost and risks it  usually  also                                   leads to faster  delivery  of  the software  however requirements  compromises  are                                   inevitable and this  may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users                                   furthermore some control  over the system evolution  is lost as new versions of  the                                   reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them                                        software reuse is very important and i have dedicated several chapters in the third                                   part of the book  to this topic  general issues of software reuse and cots reuse are                                   covered in chapter  16

incremental development they are                                   interleaved how  these activities  are carried  out depends on the  type of  software                                   people and

                                   of course the activities in the requirements process are not simply carried out in a                                   strict sequence requirements analysis continues during definition and specification and                                   new requirements come to light  throughout  the process therefore the activities  of                                   analysis definition and specification are interleaved in agile methods such as extreme                                   programming requirements are developed incrementally according to user priorities and                                   the elicitation of requirements comes from users who are part of the development team                    222 software           design    and   implementation                                   the implementation  stage of  software development  is the  process of converting  a                                   system specification into an executable system it always involves processes of soft                                   ware design and  programming  but if  an  incremental approach  to development  is                                   used may also involve refinement of the software specification                                        a software design is a description of the structure of the software to be implemented

not arrive at a finished                                   design immediately but develop the design iteratively they add formality and detail as                                   they develop their design with constant backtracking to correct earlier designs                                        figure 25 is  an abstract model of  this process showing the inputs  to the design

                      consequent design rework is inevitable in all  design processes                                       most  software interfaces with other software systems these include the operating                                   system database middleware and other application systems these make up the soft                                   ware platform the environment in which the

to integrate it with the softwares environment the requirements specification is a                                   description of  the functionality   the software must provide  and its  performance

but  may  not                                   include a  database so there is no database design involved figure  25 shows four                                   activities that may be part of the design process for information  systems                                   1 architectural     design where you identify  the overall structure  of the system the                                          principal  components  sometimes called  subsystems or modules  their rela                                          tionships and how they are distributed                                   2 interface    design where  you define the interfaces between system components                                          this  interface specification  must  be unambiguous with  a precise interface  a                                          component  can be used without   other components  having to  know  how it  is                                          implemented once interface  specifications are agreed the components can be                                          designed and developed concurrently5740 chapter    2 \\x02 software    processes                   structured methods     structured methods are an approach to software design in which graphical models that should be developed as     part of the design process are defined the method may also define a process for developing the models and rules     that apply to each model type structured methods lead to standardized documentation for a system and are     particularly useful in providing a development framework for lessexperienced and lessexpert software developers                                  httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebstructuredmethods                                   3 component   design where you take each system component and design how it will                                          operate this  may  be a simple  statement of  the  expected functionality   to  be                                          implemented with the specific design left to the programmer alternatively it may                                          be a list of changes to be made to a reusable component or a detailed design model                                          the design model may be used to automatically generate an implementation                                   4 database    design where you design the system data structures and how these are                                          to be represented in  a database again the work  here depends on whether  an                                          existing database is to be reused or a new database is to be created                                        these activities lead to a set of design outputs which are also shown in figure 25                                   the detail and representation of these vary considerably for critical systems detailed                                   design documents setting out precise and accurate descriptions of the system must be                                   produced if a modeldriven approach is used these outputs may mostly be diagrams                                   where agile methods of development are used the outputs of the design process may not                                   be separate specification documents but may be represented in the code of the program                                        structured methods for design were developed in  the 1970s and 1980s and were                                   the precursor to the uml   and objectoriented design budgen 2003 they  rely on                                   producing graphical models of the system and in many cases automatically generat                                   ing

abstract implementation                                   independent models and implementationspecific models the models are developed                                   in sufficient detail so that the executable system can be generated from them i discuss                                   this approach to development in chapter 5                                        the development of a program to implement the system follows naturally from the                                   system design processes although some classes of program such as safetycritical                                   systems are usually designed in detail before any implementation begins it  is more                                   common for  the later stages of design and program  development to be interleaved                                   software  development tools  may  be used to generate a  skeleton program  from  a                                   design this includes code to define and implement interfaces and in many cases the                                   developer need only add details of the operation of each program component                                        programming is a personal activity and there is no general process that is usually                                   followed  some programmers start with  components that  they understand develop                                   these and then move on  to lessunderstood components others  take the opposite58

                                    normally  programmers carry out some testing of the code they have developed this                                   often reveals program defects that must be

existence of defects debugging is concerned with locating and correcting these defects                                       when  you are debugging you  have to generate hypotheses about the observable                                   behavior of the program then test these hypotheses in the hope of finding the fault that                                   caused the output anomaly

created are commonly used                                   2 system   testing system  components are integrated to create a complete system                                          this  process is concerned  with  finding   errors that  result from   unanticipated                                          interactions between components and component interface  problems it  is also                                          concerned with showing that the system meets its functional and nonfunctional                                          requirements  and testing the  emergent system properties  for large  systems                                          this may be a multistage process where components are integrated to form sub                                          systems that are  individually   tested before  these subsystems are themselves                                          integrated to form  the final system                                   3 acceptance   testing this is the final  stage in the testing process before the system                                          is accepted for  operational use the system is tested with  data supplied by  the                                          system customer rather than with   simulated test data acceptance testing  may                                          reveal errors and omissions in  the system requirements definition  because the                                          real data exercise the system in  different  ways from  the test  data acceptance                                          testing may also reveal requirements problems  where the systems facilities  do                                          not really  meet the users needs or the system performance is unacceptable                                        normally   component   development   and  testing   processes  are  interleaved                                   programmers make up  their own  test data and incrementally   test the code as it  is                                   developed this is an economically sensible approach as the programmer knows the                                   component and is therefore the best person to generate test cases                                        if  an incremental  approach to  development is  used each increment  should be                                   tested as it is developed with  these tests based on the requirements for  that incre                                   ment in  extreme programming   tests are developed  along with  the  requirements                                   before development starts this  helps the  testers and developers to understand the                                   requirements and ensures that there are no delays as test cases are created                                        when a plandriven  software process is used eg for  critical  systems develop                                   ment testing is driven  by a set of test plans an independent team of  testers works                                   from  these preformulated test plans  which have been developed from  the system

as a software product  a testing process called                                   beta testing  is often used beta testing involves delivering  a system to a number of

                 the flexibility   of  software systems is one of  the main reasons why more and morein a plandrivensoftware process       software  is being incorporated in  large complex systems once a decision has been                                   made to manufacture hardware it is very expensive to make changes to the hardware                                   design however changes can be made to software  at any time  during or  after the                                   system development even extensive changes are still much cheaper than correspon                                   ding changes to system hardware                                       historically   there has always been a split between the process of software devel                                   opment and the process of software evolution software  maintenance people think                                   of software  development as a creative activity in  which  a software system is devel                                   oped from an initial  concept through to a working system however they sometimes                                   think of software  maintenance as dull and uninteresting although the costs of main                                   tenance are often several times the initial development costs maintenance processes                                   are sometimes considered to be less challenging than original software development                                       this  distinction  between development and maintenance is increasingly irrelevant                                   hardly  any software systems are completely new systems and it makes much more                                   sense to see development and maintenance as a continuum rather than two separate                                   processes it is more  realistic  to think   of software  engineering  as an evolutionary                                   process figure  28  where  software  is  continually   changed over  its  lifetime   in                                   response to changing requirements and customer needs                       23 coping              with       change                                   change is inevitable in all  large software projects the system requirements change                                   as the business procuring the system responds to external pressures and management                                   priorities change as new technologies become available new design and implemen                                   tation

         change adds to the costs of software development because it usually means that                                   work that has been completed has to be redone this is called rework for example if                                   the relationships between the requirements in a system have been analyzed and new                                   requirements are then identified  some or all  of the requirements analysis has to be                                   repeated it may then be necessary to redesign the system to deliver the new require                                   ments change any programs that have been developed and retest the system                                        there are two related approaches that may be used to reduce the costs of rework                                   1 change   avoidance where the software process includes activities that can antic                                          ipate possible changes before significant rework is required for example a pro                                          totype  system may be developed  to show some key  features of  the system to                                          customers they  can experiment  with  the  prototype  and refine  their require                                          ments before committing  to high software production  costs                                   2 change    tolerance where the process is designed so that changes can be accom                                          modated at relatively low  cost this normally  involves  some form of incremen                                          tal  development  proposed changes may be  implemented  in  increments  that                                          have not yet been developed if this is  impossible then only  a single increment                                          a small part of the system may have to be altered to incorporate the change                                        in this  section i discuss two  ways of  coping with  change and changing  system                                   requirements these are                                   1 system   prototyping where a version of the system or part of the system is developed                                          quickly  to check the customers requirements and the feasibility of  some design                                          decisions this supports change avoidance as it allows users to experiment with the                                          system before delivery and so refine their requirements the number of require                                          ments change proposals made after delivery is therefore likely to be reduced                                   2 incremental    delivery where system increments are delivered to the customer for                                          comment  and  experimentation   this   supports  both  change  avoidance  and                                          change tolerance it  avoids the premature commitment  to requirements for  the                                          whole system and allows changes to be incorporated into later increments at rel                                          atively low  cost                                        the notion of  refactoring  namely improving  the structure and organization  of a                                   program is also  an important mechanism that  supports change tolerance i discuss                                   this in chapter 3 which  covers

       system  prototypes allow  users to see how well  the system supports  their work                                   they may get new ideas for requirements and find areas of strength and weakness in                                   the software they may then propose new system requirements furthermore as the                                   prototype is developed it  may reveal

may                                   then be modified to reflect their changed understanding of the requirements                                       a  system prototype may be used while  the system is being designed to carry out                                   design experiments  to check  the feasibility   of a  proposed design for  example a                                   database design may be prototyped and tested to check that it supports efficient data                                   access for the most common user queries prototyping is also an essential part of the                                   user interface design process because of the dynamic nature of user interfaces tex                                   tual descriptions and diagrams are not good enough for expressing the user interface                                   requirements therefore  rapid  prototyping  with  enduser involvement  is  the only                                   sensible way to develop graphical user interfaces for software systems                                       a  process model for  prototype  development is shown  in figure  29 the objec                                   tives of prototyping  should be made explicit from the start of the process these may                                   be to develop a system to prototype the user interface to develop a system to validate                                   functional system requirements or to develop a system to demonstrate the feasibility6346 chapter    2 \\x02 software    processes                                   of the application to managers the same prototype cannot meet all objectives if the                                   objectives are left unstated management or endusers may misunderstand the func                                   tion of the prototype  consequently they may not get the benefits that they expected                                   from the prototype  development                                        the next stage in  the process  is to decide  what  to put  into  and perhaps more                                   importantly  what to leave out of  the prototype system to reduce prototyping  costs                                   and accelerate the delivery  schedule you may  leave some functionality   out of  the                                   prototype  you may decide  to relax  nonfunctional  requirements such as response                                   time and memory utilization  error handling and management may be ignored unless                                   the objective of the prototype  is to establish a user interface standards of reliability                                   and program quality may be reduced                                        the final  stage of the  process is prototype  evaluation provision  must be made                                   during  this stage for  user training  and the  prototype  objectives should  be used to                                   derive a plan for evaluation users need time to become comfortable with a new sys                                   tem and to settle into a normal pattern of usage once they are using the system nor                                   mally they then discover requirements errors and omissions                                        a general problem with  prototyping  is that  the prototype may not necessarily be                                   used in the same way as the final system the tester of the prototype may not be typ                                   ical of  system users the training  time during  prototype evaluation  may be insuffi                                   cient if  the prototype  is slow  the evaluators may adjust their  way of  working  and                                   avoid those system features that have slow response times when provided with bet                                   ter response in the final system they may use it in a different way                                        developers are sometimes pressured by  managers to deliver  throwaway  proto                                   types particularly  when there are delays in  delivering  the final  version of  the soft                                   ware however this is usually unwise                                   1 it    may be impossible to tune the prototype to meet nonfunctional  requirements                                          such as performance security  robustness and reliability  requirements  which                                          were ignored during  prototype development                                   2 rapid    change during development inevitably means that the prototype is undoc                                          umented the only  design specification is  the prototype code this  is not good                                          enough for longterm  maintenance                                   3 the    changes made during prototype  development will  probably  have degraded                                          the system structure the system will be difficult   and expensive to maintain                                   4 organizational    quality standards are normally relaxed for prototype development                                        prototypes do not have to  be executable to be useful  paperbased mockups of                                   the system user interface rettig  1994  can be effective in  helping  users refine an                                   interface design and work through usage scenarios these are very cheap to develop                                   and can be constructed in a few days an extension of  this technique

incremental            delivery                                   incremental delivery  figure  210  is an approach to  software development  where                                   some of the developed increments are delivered to the customer and deployed for use                                   in an operational  environment in  an incremental delivery  process customers iden                                   tify in  outline the services to be provided by the system they identify which  of the                                   services are most  important  and which  are least important   to them  a number  of                                   delivery increments are then defined with  each increment providing a subset of the                                   system functionality the allocation  of services to increments depends on the service                                   priority  with the highestpriority   services implemented and delivered first                                       once  the system increments have been identified the requirements for  the serv                                   ices to be delivered in the first  increment  are defined in detail and that increment  is                                   developed during  development further  requirements analysis for  later increments                                   can take place but requirements changes for the current increment are not accepted                                       once an increment  is completed and delivered customers can put it into  service                                   this means that they take early delivery of part of the system functionality they  can                                   experiment with the system and this helps them clarify their requirements for later sys                                   tem increments as new increments are completed they are integrated with existing                                   increments so that the system functionality improves with each delivered increment                                       incremental  delivery has a number of advantages                                   1 customers    can use the early increments as prototypes and gain experience that                                          informs their  requirements for later system increments unlike prototypes these                                          are part of the real system so there is no relearning when the complete system is                                          available                                   2 customers    do not  have to wait  until  the entire system is delivered  before they                                          can gain value from  it  the first  increment satisfies their  most critical  require                                          ments so they can use the software immediately                                   3 the    process maintains the benefits of incremental development in that it  should                                          be relatively easy to incorporate changes into the system                                   4 as     the highestpriority   services  are delivered  first  and increments  then inte                                          grated the most important system services receive the most testing this means6548 chapter    2 \\x02

the system                                        however there are problems with incremental delivery                                   1 most    systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the                                          system as  requirements are  not defined  in detail  until  an increment  is  to be                                          implemented it  can be hard to identify common  facilities that are needed by all                                          increments                                   2 iterative    development can also be difficult   when a replacement system is being                                          developed users want all  of  the functionality   of the old  system and are often                                          unwilling  to experiment with  an incomplete new system therefore getting use                                          ful  customer feedback is difficult                                   3 the    essence of iterative processes is that the specification is developed in conjunc                                          tion  with  the software however this  conflicts  with  the procurement model  of                                          many organizations where the complete system specification is part of the system                                          development contract in the incremental approach there is no complete system                                          specification until  the final  increment  is specified this  requires a new form of                                          contract which large customers such as government agencies may find difficult to                                          accommodate                                        there are some types of system where incremental  development and delivery  is                                   not the best approach these are very large systems where development may involve                                   teams working  in different  locations  some embedded systems where the software                                   depends on hardware development and some critical systems where all the require                                   ments must be analyzed to check for interactions that may compromise the safety or                                   security of the system                                        these systems of course suffer from the same problems of uncertain and chang                                   ing requirements therefore to address these problems and get some of the benefits                                   of incremental  development a process may be used in which a system prototype  is                                   developed  iteratively   and  used as a  platform   for  experiments   with  the  system                                   requirements and design with the  experience gained from the prototype  definitive                                   requirements can then be agreed                     233 boehms         spiral    model                                   a  riskdriven   software  process framework   the

 unified  process rup krutchen  2003  is an example of  a modern                                   process model that has been derived from work on the uml and the associated unified

process model                                   it brings together elements from all of the generic process models section 21 illus                                   trates good practice in

conventional process models present a single  view  of                                   the process in contrast the rup is normally described from three perspectives                                   1 a    dynamic  perspective which shows the phases of the model over time                                   2 a    static perspective which  shows the process activities that are enacted                                   3 a    practice perspective which suggests good practices to be used during the process                                        most descriptions of the rup attempt to combine the static and dynamic perspec                                   tives in a single  diagram krutchen 2003  i think  that makes the process harder to                                   understand so i use separate descriptions of each of these perspectives                                        the rup is  a phased model that identifies  four  discrete phases in  the software

goals of the elaboration phase are to develop an understanding                                          of  the problem  domain  establish an architectural   framework  for  the system

associated documentation that is ready for delivery to users                                   4 transition the      final  phase of the  rup is concerned  with  moving  the system

presenting dynamic and static views is that phases of the devel                                   opment process are not associated with specific workflows  in  principle  at least all

environment  they have torespond to new opportunities  and markets changing economic  conditions  and theemergence of competing products and services software is  part of almost  all business operations so new  software  is developed  quickly   to take  advantage of  newopportunities and to respond to competitive pressure rapid development and delivery is therefore now often the most critical requirement for software systems in factmany businesses  are willing    to  trade off   software  quality   and  compromise  onrequirements to achieve faster deployment of the software that they need    because these businesses are operating in a changing environment it is often practically impossible to derive a complete set of stable software requirements the initialrequirements inevitably change because customers find it impossible to predict how asystem will affect working  practices how it will interact with  other systems and whatuser operations should be automated it may only be after a system has been deliveredand users gain experience with it that the real requirements become clear even thenthe requirements are likely to change quickly  and unpredictably due to external factors the software may then be out of date when it is delivered    software development processes that plan on completely specifying the requirementsand then designing building and testing the system are not geared to rapid softwaredevelopment as the requirements change or as requirements problems are discoveredthe system design or implementation has to be reworked and retested as a consequencea conventional waterfall or specificationbased process is usually prolonged and the finalsoftware is delivered to the customer long after it was originally specified    for some types of software such as safetycritical control  systems where a complete analysis  of the  system is essential  a plandriven  approach  is the right  onehowever in a fastmoving  business environment this  can cause real problems bythe time the software is available for use the original reason for its procurement mayhave changed so radically that the software is effectively useless therefore for business systems in  particular  development  processes  that focus  on  rapid  softwaredevelopment and delivery are essential    the  need for rapid system development and processes that can handle changingrequirements  has been recognized   for  some time  ibm   introduced   incrementaldevelopment in the 1980s mills  et al  1980 the introduction  of  socalled fourthgeneration languages also in the  1980s supported the idea of  quickly  developingand delivering  software martin  1981  however the  notion really  took  off  in thelate 1990s with  the development of  the notion  of agile  approaches such as dsdmstapleton 1997 scrum schwaber and beedle 2001  and extreme programmingbeck 1999 beck 2000    rapid  software development processes are designed to produce useful  softwarequickly the software is not developed as a single unit but as a series of increments witheach increment   including   new  system  functionality   although    there  are  manyapproaches to rapid software development they share some fundamental characteristics1 the    processes of  specification   design and  implementation   are interleaved       there is no  detailed system  specification  and design documentation  is mini       mized or  generated automatically   by  the programming   environment  used to7558 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development

each version they  may                                          propose changes to the software  and new  requirements that should  be imple                                          mented in a later version of the system                                   3 system    user interfaces  are often  developed using  an interactive  development                                          system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by drawing and plac                                          ing icons on the interface the system may then generate a webbased interface for

the increments are                                   small and typically new releases of the system are created and made available to cus                                   tomers every two or three weeks they involve customers in the development process                                   to get rapid  feedback on changing requirements they  minimize  documentation by                                   using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents                       31 agile             methods                                   in the  1980s and early  1990s  there was a widespread  view  that  the best way  to                                   achieve better  software was  through careful  project  planning  formalized   quality                                   assurance the use of analysis and  design methods supported by  case  tools and                                   controlled  and rigorous software  development processes this view came from  the                                   software engineering  community  that  was responsible for  developing  large long                                   lived software systems such as aerospace and government systems                                        this software was developed by large teams working for different companies teams                                   were often geographically dispersed and worked on the software for  long periods of                                   time an example of this type of software is the control systems for a modern aircraft                                   which might  take up to 10 years from initial specification to deployment these plan                                   driven approaches involve a significant overhead in planning designing and document                                   ing the system this overhead is justified when the work of multiple development teams                                   has to be coordinated when the system is a critical system and when many different                                   people will be involved in maintaining the software over its lifetime                                        however when this  heavyweight plandriven  development approach is  applied                                   to small and mediumsized business systems the overhead involved is so large that it                                   dominates the software development process more time is spent on how the system                                   should  be developed  than  on program  development   and testing  as  the  system                                   requirements change rework is essential and in principle  at  least the specification                                   and design has to change with the program                                        dissatisfaction with  these heavyweight approaches to software engineering led a                                   number of software  developers in the 1990s to propose new agile  methods these                                   allowed the development team to focus on the software itself rather than on its design76                                                                                         31 \\x02 agile    methods 59and documentation agile methods universally rely on an incremental approach to software specification development and delivery they are best suited to application development where the system requirements usually change rapidly during the developmentprocess they are intended to deliver working software quickly to customers who canthen propose new and changed requirements to be included in later iterations of the system they aim to cut down on process bureaucracy by avoiding work that has dubiouslongterm value and eliminating documentation that will probably never be used    the philosophy  behind agile methods is reflected  in the agile manifesto  that wasagreed on by many of the leading developers of these methods this manifesto states    we are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing  it and helping    others do it  through this work we have come to value        individuals  and interactions  over processes and tools        working  software over comprehensive documentation         customer collaboration   over contract negotiation        responding to change over following  a plan    that is while  there is value in the items on the right we value the items on the    left  more    probably  the  bestknown  agile method  is extreme  programming

more traditional  development methods based on system modelling resulting inthe notion of agile  modelling ambler  and jeffries 2002 and agile instantiations  ofthe rational unified process larman 2002    although  these agile methods are all based around the notion of incremental development and delivery they propose different processes to achieve this however theyshare a set of principles based on the agile manifesto and so have much in commonthese principles are shown in figure 31 different agile methods instantiate these principles in different ways and i dont  have space to discuss

using these methods for other types of softwaremethods                     development however  because of their  focus  on small  tightly  integrated  teams                                   there are problems in  scaling them  to large systems there  have also been experi                                   ments in  using  agile approaches  for critical   systems engineering   drobna  et al                                   2004 however because of the need for security safety and dependability analysis                                   in critical  systems agile methods require significant modification  before they can be                                   routinely  used for critical systems engineering                                       in  practice  the principles  underlying   agile methods  are sometimes difficult   to                                   realize                                   1 although     the  idea of customer  involvement  in  the development process is  an                                          attractive one its success depends on having a customer who is willing and able                                          to spend  time with   the development  team and  who can  represent all  system                                          stakeholders frequently the customer representatives are subject to other pres                                          sures and cannot take full part in the software development                                   2 individual      team members may  not have suitable  personalities  for  the intense                                          involvement that is typical  of agile methods and therefore not interact well with                                          other team members                                   3 prioritizing     changes can be extremely difficult  especially  in systems for which                                          there are many stakeholders typically  each stakeholder gives different priori                                          ties to different  changes                                   4 maintaining      simplicity    requires  extra  work   under  pressure from   delivery                                          schedules the team members may not have time  to carry out  desirable system                                          simplifications78                                                                                         31 \\x02 agile    methods 615 many     organizations  especially  large  companies have spent  years changing       their culture so that processes are defined and followed it is difficult for  them to       move to a working model in which  processes are informal and defined by devel       opment teams    another   nontechnical  problem—that   is  a general  problem  with   incrementaldevelopment and delivery—occurs when the system customer uses an outside organization for system development the software requirements document is usually partof the contract between the customer and the supplier because incremental specification is inherent  in agile  methods writing   contracts for  this type  of developmentmay be difficult    consequently agile methods have to rely on contracts in which the customer paysfor the time  required for system development rather than the development of  a specific set of requirements so long as all goes well this benefits both the customer andthe developer however if  problems arise then there may be difficult   disputes overwho is  to blame and  who should  pay for  the extra  time and resources required  toresolve the problems    most  books and  papers that describe agile methods  and experiences with  agilemethods  talk  about  the  use  of  these  methods  for   new  systems  developmenthowever as i explain  in  chapter 9 a huge  amount of  software engineering  effortgoes into the maintenance and evolution of existing software systems there are onlya small number of  experience reports on using  agile methods for  software maintenance poole and huisman 2001  there are two  questions that should be considered when considering agile methods and maintenance1 are    systems that are developed using an agile approach maintainable given the       emphasis in the development process of minimizing formal  documentation2 can    agile methods be used effectively for evolving  a system in response to cus       tomer change requests    formal  documentation is  supposed to describe the system and so make it easierfor people  changing the system to  understand in  practice however formal  documentation is often not kept up to date and so does not accurately reflect the programcode for this  reason agile methods enthusiasts argue that it  is a waste of  time towrite this documentation  and that the key to implementing  maintainable software isto produce  highquality   readable code  agile  practices  therefore  emphasize theimportance of  writing   wellstructured  code  and investing  effort  in code  improvement therefore the lack of  documentation should not be a problem in  maintainingsystems developed using an agile approach    however my  experience of system maintenance suggests that the key documentis the system requirements  document  which  tells the  software engineer  what thesystem is supposed to do without such knowledge it is difficult to assess the impactof proposed system changes many  agile methods collect  requirements informallyand incrementally   and do  not  create a coherent  requirements  document  in  this7962 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development                                   respect the use of agile methods is likely   to make subsequent system maintenance                                   more difficult  and expensive                                       agile  practices used in the maintenance process itself are likely  to  be effective                                   whether or not an agile approach has been used for system development incremental                                   delivery design for change and maintaining simplicity  all make sense when software                                   is being changed in fact you can think of an agile development process as a process                                   of software evolution                                       however  the main difficulty   after  software delivery  is likely  to  be keeping cus                                   tomers involved in  the process although a customer may be able to justify  the full                                   time involvement  of  a representative during system development this is  less likely                                   during maintenance where changes are not continuous customer representatives are                                   likely  to  lose interest in  the system therefore  it  is likely   that alternative  mecha                                   nisms such as change proposals discussed in chapter 25 will be required to create                                   the new system requirements                                       the  other problem that is likely  to arise is maintaining  continuity  of the develop                                   ment team  agile   methods rely  on  team members  understanding  aspects of  the                                   system without  having  to consult  documentation if  an  agile development  team is                                   broken up then this implicit  knowledge  is lost and it is difficult   for new team mem                                   bers to build up the same understanding of the system and its components                                       supporters  of  agile methods have been evangelical  in  promoting  their  use and                                   have tended to overlook their  shortcomings this  has prompted an equally extreme                                   response which in my view exaggerates the problems with this approach stephens                                   and  rosenberg  2003  more   reasoned  critics   such  as  demarco   and  boehm                                   demarco  and boehm  2002 highlight   both the  advantages and disadvantages of                                   agile methods  they propose a hybrid   approach where agile  methods incorporate                                   some techniques from plandriven development may be the best

in an agile approach                                   iteration  occurs across activities   therefore  the requirements  and the  design are                                   developed together

documentation                                        in fact  most  software  projects  include   practices  from  plandriven   and agile                                   approaches to decide on the balance between a planbased and an agile approach                                   you have to answer a range of technical human and organizational questions                                     1 is  it important  to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to                                          implementation if  so you probably need to use a plandriven approach                                     2 is  an incremental delivery strategy where you deliver the software to customers                                          and get rapid feedback from them realistic if so consider using agile methods                                     3 how  large is the system that is being developed agile methods are most effec                                          tive when  the system can be developed with  a small  colocated team who can                                          communicate informally  this may not be possible for large systems that require                                          larger development teams so a plandriven approach may have to be used                                     4 what  type  of system is being developed systems that require a lot of  analysis                                          before  implementation  eg  realtime  system  with  complex  timing  require                                          ments usually  need a fairly  detailed design to  carry out this  analysis a  plan                                          driven approach may be best in those circumstances                                     5 what  is the expected system lifetime longlifetime   systems may require more                                          design documentation   to communicate  the  original  intentions   of  the system8164 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development                                          developers to the  support team however  supporters of agile  methods rightly                                          argue that documentation is frequently  not kept up to date and it is not of  much                                          use for longterm system maintenance                                     6 what  technologies are available to support system development agile methods                                          often rely on good tools  to keep track of an evolving design if  you are develop                                          ing a system using an ide that  does not have good tools for program visualiza                                          tion and analysis then more design documentation may be required                                     7 how  is the development team organized if the development team is distributed                                          or if  part of the development is being outsourced then you may need to develop                                          design documents  to  communicate  across the development  teams you  may                                          need to plan in advance what these are                                     8 are   there cultural  issues that may affect  the system development traditional                                          engineering organizations  have a culture of  planbased development as this is                                          the norm in engineering this  usually requires extensive design documentation                                          rather than the informal  knowledge used in agile processes                                     9 how   good are the designers and programmers  in the  development team it  is                                          sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than planbased                                          approaches in which programmers simply  translate a detailed design into code                                          if  you have a team with relatively low  skill  levels you may need to use the best                                          people to develop the design with others responsible for programming                                   10 is  the system subject to external regulation if a system has to be approved by an                                          external regulator eg the federal aviation authority   faa  approve software                                          that is critical  to the operation of an aircraft  then you will  probably be required                                          to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case                                       in  reality the issue of whether a project  can be labelled as plandriven or agile is                                   not very important  ultimately  the primary  concern of  buyers of a software system                                   is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and                                   does useful things for the individual  user or the organization in practice many com                                   panies who claim to have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and                                   have integrated these with their plandriven processes                       33 extreme                programming                                   extreme

new medication   or formulary                                               if she selects current medication the system asks her to check the dose if she                                               wants to change the dose she enters the dose and then confirms  the prescription                                               if she chooses new medication the system assumes that she knows which

drugs starting with these letters she chooses the required                                               medication and the  system responds by asking her to check that the medication                                               selected is correct she enters the dose and then confirms the prescription                                               if she chooses formulary the system displays a

                             new   versions   of  the  software    may  be  built   several   times   per  day  and  releases  are                                       delivered     to  customers    roughly     every   two   weeks    release   deadlines    are   never                                       slipped   if  there  are  development    problems   the  customer   is consulted   and  function                                       ality   is removed   from   the planned   release                                             when  a programmer    builds  the  system  to create  a new  version  he  or she must  run                                       all  existing    automated   tests  as  well   as the  tests  for  the  new  functionality      the  new                                       build   of   the  software    is  accepted   only   if  all   tests  execute   successfully     this  then                                       becomes  the  basis  for  the  next  iteration   of  the system                                             a  fundamental     precept   of  traditional      software   engineering     is  that   you  should                                       design  for   change  that  is  you  should   anticipate   future   changes  to the  software   and                                       design   it  so  that  these  changes  can  be  easily  implemented     extreme   programming                                       however   has discarded   this  principle    on  the basis  that  designing    for  change  is  often                                       wasted  effort   it  isnt   worth   taking   time  to  add  generality   to  a program    to cope  with                                       change   the  changes   anticipated    often   never  materialize    and  completely     different                                       change   requests   may  actually    be  made   therefore    the  xp   approach   accepts   that                                       changes  will   happen  and  reorganize   the software   when  these  changes  actually   occur8568 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development

       a  general problem  with  incremental development  is that it  tends to degrade the                                   software structure so changes to the software  become harder and harder to imple                                   ment essentially  the development proceeds by finding  workarounds  to problems                                   with the result that code is often duplicated  parts of the software are reused in inap                                   propriate ways and the overall structure degrades as code is added to the system                                       extreme   programming   tackles  this  problem  by  suggesting  that the  software                                   should be constantly  refactored  this  means that the programming   team look  for                                   possible improvements  to the software  and implement  them immediately  when  a                                   team member sees code that can be improved they make these improvements even                                   in situations  where there is  no immediate  need for them  examples of  refactoring                                   include the  reorganization of  a class hierarchy  to remove duplicate  code the tidy                                   ing up  and renaming of  attributes and methods  and the replacement of  code with                                   calls to methods defined in a program  library program development  environments                                   such as eclipse  carlson 2005  include  tools  for  refactoring  which  simplify   the                                   process of  finding  dependencies between  code sections and  making  global  code                                   modifications                                       in  principle then the software should always be easy to understand and change as                                   new stories  are implemented  in practice  this  is not  always the  case sometimes                                   development pressure means that refactoring is delayed because the time is devoted                                   to the implementation  of new functionality   some new features and changes cannot                                   readily be  accommodated by codelevel refactoring  and require  the architecture of                                   the system to be modified                                       in  practice many companies that have adopted xp do not  use all of the extreme                                   programming practices listed in  figure 34 they pick  and choose according to their                                   local ways of  working  for example some companies find  pair programming  help                                   ful  others prefer to use individual  programming and reviews to accommodate dif                                   ferent levels of  skill  some programmers dont do refactoring  in parts of  the system                                   they did  not develop and conventional  requirements may  be used rather than user                                   stories

important differences             between incremental  development and plandriven  development is  in  the way that             the system is tested with incremental development there is no system specification             that can  be used by an external  testing team to  develop system tests as  a conse             quence some approaches to incremental development have a very informal   testing             process in comparison with plandriven  testing                  to avoid some of  the problems of testing  and system validation xp  emphasizes             the importance of  program testing xp  includes an approach to testing  that reduces             the chances of introducing undiscovered errors into the current version of the system                  the key features of testing in xp  are             1 testfirst     development             2 incremental     test development from scenarios             3 user    involvement in  the test development and validation and             4 the    use of automated testing frameworks                  testfirst development is one of the most important  innovations in  xp instead of             writing  some code and then writing tests for that code you write the tests before you             write  the code this means that you can run the test as the code is being written and             discover problems during  development                  writing  tests implicitly   defines both an interface  and a specification of  behavior             for the functionality  being developed problems of requirements and interface misun             derstandings are reduced this approach can be adopted in any process in which there             is a clear relationship between a system requirement and the code implementing that             requirement in xp you can always see this link because the story cards representing             the requirements are broken down  into  tasks and the tasks are the principal  unit of             implementation the adoption of testfirst development in xp has led to more general             testdriven approaches to development astels 2003 i discuss these in chapter 8                  in testfirst  development  the task implementers  have to thoroughly  understand             the specification so that they can write tests for the system this means that ambigu             ities  and omissions in  the specification  have to be clarified  before  implementation             begins furthermore it also avoids the problem of  testlag  this may happen when             the developer of  the system works at a faster pace than the tester the implementa             tion gets further and further  ahead of the testing and there is a tendency to skip tests             so that the development schedule can be maintained                  user requirements in xp are expressed as scenarios or stories and the user priori             tizes  these for  development  the  development  team assesses each scenario and             breaks it  down into  tasks for example some of the task cards developed from  the             story card for prescribing  medication figure 35 are shown in figure 36 each task             generates one or more unit tests that check the implementation described in that task             figure 37 is  a shortened description of a test

    the role  of the customer in the testing process is to help develop acceptance tests                                   for the stories that are to be implemented in the next release of the system as i dis                                   cuss in chapter 8 acceptance testing is the process where the system is tested using                                   customer data to check that it meets the customers real needs                                       in  xp acceptance testing like development is incremental the customer who is                                   part of the team writes tests as development proceeds all new code is therefore val                                   idated to ensure that it  is what  the customer needs for the story in  figure 35  the                                   acceptance test would involve scenarios where a the dose of  a drug was changed                                   b a new drug was selected and c the formulary  was used to find a drug in prac                                   tice a series of acceptance tests rather than a single test are normally required                                       relying  on  the customer to support acceptance test development is sometimes a                                   major difficulty   in  the xp  testing process people adopting the customer role  have                                   very limited  available time  and may not be able to work  fulltime  with  the develop                                   ment team the customer may feel that providing  the requirements was enough of a                                   contribution  and so may be reluctant to get involved in the testing process                                       test automation is essential for testfirst development tests are written as executable                                   components before the task is implemented these testing components should be stand                                   alone should simulate the submission of input to be tested and should check that the                                   result meets the output specification  an automated test framework  is a system that                                   makes it easy to write  executable tests and submit a set of tests for execution junit                                   massol and husted 2003 is a widely used example of an automated testing framework                                       as  testing is automated there is always a set of tests that can be quickly and eas                                   ily executed whenever any functionality  is added to the system the tests can be run                                   and problems that the new code has introduced can be caught immediately                                       testfirst  development and automated testing usually results in a large number of                                   tests being written and executed however this approach does not necessarily lead to                                   thorough program testing there are three reasons for this                                   1 programmers    prefer programming  to testing and sometimes they take shortcuts                                          when writing   tests for example  they may  write  incomplete tests that  do not                                          check for all  possible exceptions that may occur88                                                                                          33 \\x02 extreme    programming 71              2 some    tests can be very difficult  to write  incrementally  for example in a com                     plex user interface it is often difficult   to write  unit tests for the code that imple                     ments the display logic  and workflow   between screens              3 it    difficult   to judge the completeness of a set of tests although you may have a                     lot  of system tests your  test set may  not provide  complete  coverage crucial                     parts of the system may not be executed and so remain untested                  therefore  although a large set of frequently  executed tests may give the impres              sion that the system is complete and correct this may not be the case if the tests are              not reviewed and further  tests written after development then undetected bugs may              be delivered in the system release332 pair       programming              another  innovative  practice  that has been introduced  in  xp  is that  programmers              work in pairs to develop the software they actually sit together at the same worksta              tion  to  develop  the software   however  the same  pairs  do not  always  program              together rather pairs are created dynamically so that all  team members work with              each other during the development process                  the use of pair  programming has a number of advantages              1 it     supports the idea of  collective  ownership and responsibility   for  the system                     this  reflects weinbergs  1971 idea of  egoless programming  where the  soft                     ware is owned by  the team as a whole and individuals  are not held responsible                     for  problems with  the code instead the  team has collective responsibility   for                     resolving these problems              2 it    acts as an informal review process because each line of code is looked at by at                     least two people code inspections and reviews covered in chapter 24 are very                     successful in discovering  a high  percentage of software  errors however they                     are time consuming  to organize and typically  introduce delays into  the devel                     opment process although pair programming  is a less formal process that prob                     ably  doesnt  find  as many  errors  as code inspections   it  is a much  cheaper                     inspection process than formal program inspections              3 it    helps support refactoring which is a process of software improvement the diffi                     culty of  implementing this in  a normal development environment is that effort in                     refactoring is expended for longterm benefit an individual  who practices refac                     toring may be judged to be less efficient than one who simply carries on developing                     code where pair programming and collective ownership are used others benefit                     immediately from the refactoring so they are likely to support the process                  you might  think that pair programming would be less efficient than individual pro              gramming in a given time a pair of  developers would produce half as much code as8972 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development                                   two individuals  working alone there have been various studies of the productivity of                                   paid programmers with   mixed results using  student volunteers  williams  and her                                   collaborators cockburn and williams   2001 williams  et al 2000  found that pro                                   ductivity  with  pair  programming  seems to be comparable with   that of  two people                                   working  independently  the reasons suggested are that pairs discuss the  software                                   before development so probably have fewer false starts and less rework furthermore                                   the number of errors avoided by the informal inspection is such that less time is spent                                   repairing bugs discovered during the testing process                                        however studies with   more experienced programmers  arisholm   et al  2007                                   parrish et al 2004 did not replicate these results they found that there was a signifi                                   cant loss of productivity compared with two programmers working  alone there were                                   some quality  benefits but these did not  fully  compensate for the pairprogramming                                   overhead nevertheless the sharing of knowledge that happens during pair program                                   ming is very important as it reduces the overall risks to a project when team members                                   leave in itself this may make pair programming worthwhile                       34 agile             project          management                                   the principal responsibility  of software  project managers is to manage the project so                                   that the software is delivered on time  and within  the planned budget for the project                                   they supervise the work  of  software engineers and monitor  how well  the software                                   development is progressing                                        the standard approach  to project  management  is plandriven   as i  discuss in                                   chapter 23 managers draw up a plan for the project showing  what should be deliv                                   ered when it should be delivered and who will work on the development of the proj                                   ect deliverables a  planbased approach really requires  a manager to have a stable                                   view  of   everything  that   has to  be  developed  and  the  development  processes                                   however  it  does not work   well  with  agile  methods  where the  requirements  are                                   developed incrementally where the software is delivered  in short rapid increments                                   and where changes to the requirements and the software are the norm                                        like every  other professional software  development process agile development                                   has to be managed so that the best use is made of the time and resources available to                                   the team  this  requires  a  different   approach  to  project  management  which  is                                   adapted to incremental development and the particular strengths of agile methods                                        the scrum approach schwaber 2004 schwaber and beedle 2001 is a general                                   agile method but its focus  is on managing iterative development rather than specific                                   technical approaches to agile software engineering figure 38 is a diagram of the scrum

cycles where each cycle develops an increment                                   of the  system finally  the  project  closure phase wraps up  the project  completes

innovative  feature of  scrum  is its  central phase namely  the sprint  cycles                                   a scrum sprint  is a planning unit  in which  the work to be done is assessed features                                   are selected for  development  and  the software  is  implemented  at  the  end of  a                                   sprint the completed  functionality  is  delivered to  stakeholders key characteristics                                   of this process are as follows                                   1 sprints    are fixed  length normally  2–4 weeks they correspond to  the develop                                          ment of a release of the system in xp                                   2 the    starting point  for planning  is the product backlog which  is the list  of work                                          to be  done on the  project  during  the assessment phase of the  sprint  this  is                                          reviewed and priorities and risks are assigned the customer is closely involved                                          in this  process and can introduce new requirements or tasks at the beginning of                                          each sprint                                   3 the    selection phase involves all of the project team who work with the customer                                          to select the features and functionality to  be developed during the sprint                                   4 once    these are agreed the team organizes themselves to develop the software                                          short daily  meetings  involving  all  team members are held  to review  progress                                          and if  necessary reprioritize work  during  this stage the team is isolated  from                                          the customer and the organization with all  communications channelled through                                          the socalled  scrum  master  the role  of  the scrum  master is to  protect the                                          development  team from  external  distractions  the way  in  which  the work  is                                          done depends on the problem  and the team unlike  xp scrum does not  make                                          specific  suggestions on how to  write requirements  testfirst development  etc                                          however these xp practices can be used if the team thinks they are appropriate                                   5 at    the end of the sprint the work done is reviewed and presented to stakeholders                                          the next sprint cycle then begins                                        the idea behind  scrum  is that the  whole  team should  be empowered to  make                                   decisions so the term project  manager  has been deliberately avoided rather the9174 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development                                   scrum  master is  a facilitator  who  arranges daily meetings  tracks the backlog  of

is planned for  the following   day this means that everyone on the                                   team knows what is  going on and if  problems arise can replan shortterm  work  to

          there are many anecdotal reports of the successful use of scrum available on the                                   web rising  and janoff  2000 discuss  its successful use in  a telecommunication                                   software development environment and they list its advantages as follows                                   1 the     product  is  broken  down  into

is established and a positive culture is                                          created in which everyone expects the project to succeed                                       scrum  as originally designed was intended for use with  colocated teams where                                   all  team members could  get  together  every day  in standup  meetings  however                                   much software  development  now  involves  distributed  teams with  team  members                                   located in different  places around the world consequently there are various

            work  together in the same room and communicate  informally  agile  methods have                                   therefore been mostly used for the development of small and mediumsized systems                                   of course the need for faster delivery of software which  is more suited to customer                                   needs also applies to larger  systems consequently there has been a great deal of                                   interest in  scaling  agile methods to  cope with  larger  systems developed by  large                                   organizations92                                                                            35 \\x02 scaling    agile methods 75    denning et al 2008 argue that the only way to avoid common software engineering problems such as systems that dont meet customer needs and budget overruns isto find ways of making agile methods work for large systems leffingwell 2007 discusses which agile practices scale to large systems development moore  and spens2008 report on their experience of using an agile approach to develop a large medical system with 300 developers working in geographically distributed  teams    large  software system development is different  from  small system developmentin a number of ways1 large    systems  are usually  collections   of  separate communicating   systems       where separate teams develop each system frequently these teams are working       in different  places sometimes in different  time zones it is  practically  impossi       ble for each team to have a view of the whole system consequently their prior       ities are usually  to complete  their part  of the  system without  regard for  wider       systems issues2 large    systems are brownfield   systems  hopkins  and jenkins  2008 that  is       they include and interact with a number of existing systems many of the system       requirements are concerned with this interaction  and so dont really  lend them       selves to flexibility    and incremental development  political  issues can also be       significant here—often  the easiest solution to a problem is to change an existing       system however this requires negotiation with  the managers of that system to       convince them that the changes can be implemented without risk to the systems       operation3 where    several systems are integrated to create a system a significant fraction of       the development  is concerned with   system configuration  rather  than original       code development this is not necessarily compatible with incremental develop       ment and frequent system integration4 large    systems and their development processes are often constrained by exter       nal rules  and  regulations  limiting   the  way  that they  can be  developed  that       require certain types of system documentation to be produced etc5 large    systems have a long procurement and development time it is  difficult  to       maintain  coherent  teams  who  know  about  the  system over  that  period   as       inevitably people move on to other jobs and projects6 large   systems usually have a diverse set of stakeholders for example nurses and       administrators may be the endusers of a medical system but senior medical staff       hospital managers etc are also stakeholders in the system it is practically impos       sible to involve all of these different stakeholders in the development process    there are two perspectives on the scaling of agile methods1 a     scaling  up  perspective which  is concerned  with  using these methods for       developing large software systems that cannot be developed by a small team9376 chapter    3 \\x02 agile    software  development                                   2 a    scaling  out  perspective which is concerned with  how agile methods can be                                          introduced across a large organization with many years of software development                                          experience                                        agile  methods  have  to  be adapted  to  cope with   large  systems engineering                                   leffingwell   2007 argues that it  is essential to maintain  the fundamentals of  agile                                   methods—flexible  planning  frequent system releases continuous integration  test                                   driven development and good team communications i believe that the critical adap                                   tations that have to be introduced are as follows                                   1 for    large systems development it is not possible to focus only on the code of the                                          system you need to  do more upfront  design and system documentation  the                                          software architecture has to be designed and there has to be documentation pro                                          duced to describe critical  aspects of the system such as database schemas the                                          work breakdown  across teams etc                                   2 crossteam    communication   mechanisms have to  be designed and  used this                                          should involve regular phone and video conferences between team members and                                          frequent short electronic  meetings where teams update each other on progress                                          arange  of  communication  channels such as email  instant messaging wikis                                          and social networking systems should be provided to facilitate communications                                   3 continuous    integration  where the whole  system is built  every time  any devel                                          oper checks in  a change is practically   impossible  when several separate pro                                          grams have to  be integrated  to create  the system however  it  is essential  to                                          maintain  frequent system builds  and regular  releases of the system this  may                                          mean that new  configuration  management tools  that support  multiteam  soft                                          ware development have to be introduced                                        small software companies that develop software products have been amongst the                                   most enthusiastic adopters of agile methods these companies are not constrained by                                   organizational  bureaucracies or process standards and they can change quickly   to                                   adopt new  ideas of course  larger companies  have also experimented  with  agile                                   methods in  specific  projects but  it is  much more  difficult   for  them to  scale out                                   these methods across the organization  lindvall  et al  2004 discuss some of  the                                   problems in scalingout agile  methods in four large technology companies                                        it is  difficult   to introduce  agile  methods into  large companies  for a  number of                                   reasons                                   1 project    managers who do not have experience of agile methods may be reluctant                                          to accept the risk  of a new  approach as they do not know  how this  will  affect                                          their particular  projects                                   2 large    organizations often have quality procedures and standards that all projects                                          are expected to follow and because of their bureaucratic nature these are likely to                                          be incompatible with agile methods sometimes these are supported by software94

                                     for all projects                                 3 agile     methods seem to  work best when  team members have a relatively  high                                        skill  level  however within   large organizations  there are likely   to be a  wide                                        range of skills and abilities  and people with lower skill  levels may not be effec                                        tive team members in agile processes                                 4 there   may be cultural resistance to agile methods especially in those organizations                                        that have a long history of using conventional systems engineering processes                                      change management and testing  procedures are examples  of company  proce                                 dures that may  not be compatible  with  agile  methods change management is the                                 process of controlling   changes to  a system so that  the impact  of  changes is pre                                 dictable and costs are controlled all changes have to be approved in advance before                                 they are made and this conflicts with  the notion of refactoring  in xp any developer                                 can improve any code without getting external approval for large systems there are                                 also testing  standards where a system  build  is handed over  to an external  testing                                 team this may conflict  with  the testfirst and testoften approaches used in xp                                      introducing and sustaining the use of agile methods across a large organization is                                 a process of cultural  change cultural  change takes a long  time  to implement  and                                 often requires a change of  management before it can be accomplished companies                                 wishing to use agile methods need evangelists to promote change they must devote                                 significant resources to the change process

requirements for a system are the descriptions of  what the system should do—the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation these requirementsreflect the needs of customers for a system that serves a certain purpose such as controlling  a device  placing an  order or finding   information  the  process of findingout analyzing  documenting  and checking these services and constraints  is calledrequirements engineering re    the term  requirement  is not used consistently in the software industry  in somecases a requirement is simply a highlevel abstract statement of a service that a system should provide or a constraint on a system at the other extreme it is a detailedformal definition  of  a system function davis 1993  explains why these differencesexist    if  a company wishes to let a contract for a large software development project    it  must define its needs in a sufficiently abstract way that a solution  is not pre    defined the requirements must be written  so that several contractors can  bid    for  the contract offering  perhaps different ways of meeting the client organi    zations  needs once a contract has been awarded the contractor must write a    system definition for the client  in more detail so that the client understands and    can validate  what the software will  do both of these documents may be called    the requirements document for the system    some of the problems  that arise during the requirements engineering process area result  of  failing   to  make a  clear separation  between  these different   levels  ofdescription  i distinguish   between them by  using  the term user  requirements  tomean the highlevel  abstract requirements and  system requirements  to  mean thedetailed description  of  what the system  should do user  requirements and systemrequirements may be defined as follows1 user    requirements are statements in a natural language plus diagrams of what       services the system is expected to  provide to  system users and the constraints       under which it  must operate2 system    requirements  are more detailed  descriptions of  the software  systems       functions services and operational constraints the system requirements docu       ment sometimes called a functional specification should define exactly what  is       to be implemented it may be part of the contract between the system buyer and       the software developers    different   levels of  requirements are useful because they communicate information about the system to different types of reader figure 41 illustrates the distinctionbetween user and system  requirements  this  example from  a mental  health  carepatient management system  mhcpms   shows how  a user requirement  may beexpanded into several system  requirements you  can see from figure  41 that  theuser requirement is  quite general the  system requirements provide  more specificinformation about the services and functions of the system that is to be implemented10184 chapter    4 \\x02 requirements    engineering                                              user requirement definition

concerned                                   with  how it  will  support the business processes or because they are involved in the                                   system implementation

still   the case that there is a                                   clearly  identifiable  requirements  engineering  phase before the implementation   of                                    the system begins the outcome is a requirements document which may be part of the                                   system development contract  of  course there are usually  subsequent changes to                                    the requirements and user requirements may be expanded into more detailed system                                   requirements  however the  agile approach  of  concurrently  eliciting   the  require                                   ments as the system is developed is rarely used for large systems development                       41 functional                   and

services                                        in reality the distinction between different  types of requirement is not as clearcut                                   as these simple definitions   suggest a  user requirement  concerned with   security                                   such as a statement limiting   access to authorized  users may  appear to be a non                                   functional  requirement however when  developed in more  detail this  requirement                                   may generate other  requirements  that are  clearly  functional   such as the need to                                   include user authentication facilities  in the system                                        this shows that requirements are not independent and that one requirement often                                   generates or constrains other requirements the system requirements therefore do not                                   just specify the services or the features of the system that are required they also specify                                   the necessary functionality to ensure that these servicesfeatures are delivered properly

requirements depend on the type of software being developed the expected users of                                   the software  and  the general  approach  taken by  the organization   when  writing                                   requirements when  expressed as user requirements  functional  requirements  are                                   usually  described  in  an  abstract  way  that  can be  understood  by  system  users                                   however more  specific functional  system  requirements describe the system func                                   tions its inputs and outputs exceptions etc in detail                                        functional system  requirements vary  from general  requirements covering  what                                   the system should do to very specific requirements reflecting  local ways of  working                                   or an organizations existing  systems for example here are examples of

specific    needs of system users they may be new functional requirements in their own right constrain existing    functional requirements or set out how particular computations must be carried out        the problem with domain requirements is that software engineers may not understand the characteristics of    the domain in which the system operates they often cannot tell whether or not a domain requirement has    been missed out or conflicts with other requirements                          httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebrequirementsdomainreqhtml

                    system these have been taken from the user requirements document and they show                                   that functional   requirements may  be written  at  different  levels  of detail  contrast                                   requirements 1 and 3                                       imprecision  in the requirements specification  is the cause of many software engi                                   neering problems  it  is  natural for  a system  developer to  interpret  an ambiguous                                   requirement in a way  that simplifies  its implementation  often  however this is not                                   what the  customer wants  new requirements  have to  be established  and changes                                   made to the system of course this delays system delivery and increases costs                                       for example the first example requirement for the mhcpms states that a user shall                                   be able to search the appointments lists for all clinics the rationale for this requirement                                   is that patients with mental health problems are sometimes confused they may have an                                   appointment at one clinic but actually go to a different clinic  if they have an appoint                                   ment they will be recorded as having attended irrespective of the clinic                                       the medical  staff member specifying this may expect search to mean that given                                   a patient  name the system looks  for  that name  in all  appointments  at all  clinics                                   however this is not explicit  in the requirement system developers may interpret the                                   requirement in  a different  way and may implement  a search so that the user has to                                   choose a clinic then carry out the search this obviously will involve  more user input                                   and so take longer                                       in  principle  the functional requirements specification of  a system should be both                                   complete and consistent completeness means that all services required by the user                                   should be defined consistency means that requirements should not have contradictory104                                                      41 \\x02 functional    and nonfunctional   requirements 87             definitions   in practice  for  large complex  systems it  is practically   impossible to             achieve requirements consistency and completeness one reason for this is that it is easy             to  make mistakes and omissions when writing   specifications for  complex  systems             another reason is that there are many stakeholders in a large system a stakeholder is a             person or role that is affected by the system in some way stakeholders have different—             and often  inconsistent—needs these inconsistencies may not be obvious when the             requirements are first specified so inconsistent requirements are included in the specifi             cation the  problems may only emerge after deeper analysis or after the system has             been delivered to the customer412 nonfunctional            requirements             nonfunctional   requirements  as the name suggests are requirements that  are not             directly   concerned with  the specific  services delivered  by the  system to its  users             they may relate to emergent system properties such as reliability response time and             store occupancy alternatively they may define constraints on the system implemen             tation such as the capabilities of io devices or the data representations used in inter             faces with  other systems                  nonfunctional  requirements such as performance security or availability usually             specify or  constrain characteristics of the system as a whole nonfunctional require             ments are often more critical than individual functional requirements system users can             usually find ways to work around a system function that doesnt really meet their needs             however failing to meet a nonfunctional requirement can mean that the whole system             is unusable for example if an aircraft system does not meet its reliability requirements             it will  not be certified as safe for operation if an embedded control system fails to meet             its performance requirements the control functions will not operate correctly                  although   it is  often possible  to identify   which  system components  implement             specific  functional   requirements  eg  there may be  formatting   components that             implement  reporting requirements it  is often more difficult  to relate components to             nonfunctional  requirements the implementation  of these requirements may be dif             fused throughout the system there are two reasons for this             1 nonfunctional       requirements may  affect  the overall  architecture  of  a system                    rather than the individual  components for example to ensure that performance                    requirements  are met you may have to  organize the system to minimize  com                    munications  between components             2 a     single nonfunctional requirement such as a security requirement may generate                    a number of  related functional requirements that define new system services that                    are required in  addition it  may also generate requirements that restrict existing                    requirements                  nonfunctional

privacy                                   is obviously a very important issue in healthcare systems and the requirement specifies                                   that the system should be developed in accordance with a national privacy standard                                        a common problem  with  nonfunctional  requirements is that users or customers                                   often propose these requirements as general goals such as ease of use the ability of                                   the system to recover from failure  or rapid user response goals set out good inten                                   tions but cause problems for system developers as they leave scope for interpretation                                   and subsequent dispute once the system

rewritten this to show how the goal could  be expressed as a testable non                                   functional  requirement it is  impossible to objectively  verify  the system goal but in

  functional  requirementsnonfunctional                 in  practice customers for  a system often find  it  difficult  to  translate their  goalsrequirements              into measurable requirements for some goals such as maintainability there are no                                   metrics that can be used in other cases even when quantitative specification is pos                                   sible customers may not  be able to relate their  needs to these specifications they                                   dont understand what some number defining  the required reliability  say means in                                   terms of their everyday experience with  computer systems furthermore the cost of                                   objectively  verifying  measurable nonfunctional requirements can be very high and                                   the customers paying for the system may not think these costs are justified                                       nonfunctional    requirements  often  conflict  and  interact  with  other functional                                   or nonfunctional   requirements   for example  the  authentication  requirement

in practice  to separate functional and nonfunctional  requirements                                   in the  requirements document if  the  nonfunctional  requirements are stated sepa                                   rately from the functional  requirements the relationships between them may be hard                                   to understand however you should explicitly highlight  requirements that are clearly                                   related to emergent system properties such as performance or reliability you can do                                   this by putting them in  a separate section of the requirements document or by distin                                   guishing them in some way from  other system requirements108

methods argue that requirements                              change so rapidly that a requirements document is out of date as soon as it is written                              so the effort  is largely  wasted rather than a formal  document approaches such as                              extreme programming   beck 1999  collect  user requirements  incrementally  and

for  business systems where requirements are unstable i think that this approach                              is a good one however i think that it is still  useful to write  a short supporting docu

neers who have to adapt the system to new requirements                                       the level of  detail that you should include in a requirements document depends on                                   the type of system that is being developed and the development process used critical                                   systems need to have detailed requirements because safety and security

     less detailed and any ambiguities can be resolved during development of the system                                       figure  47 shows one possible organization  for  a requirements document that is                                   based on an ieee standard for requirements documents ieee 1998 this standard                                   is a  generic  standard  that can  be adapted

the  information  that is  included in  a requirements document depends                                   on the type of software  being developed and the approach to development that is to

chapter    4 \\x02 requirements    engineering       fpo problems   with using natural language for requirements specification     the flexibility of natural language which is so useful for specification often causes problems there is scope for     writing unclear requirements and readers the designers may misinterpret requirements because they have a     different background to the user it is easy to amalgamate several requirements into a single sentence and     structuring natural language requirements can be difficult                         httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebrequirementsnlproblemshtml                                   to a fine level of  detail this means that the requirements documents are likely to be                                   very long and should include most if  not all of  the chapters shown in figure 47 for                                   long documents it is particularly  important to include  a comprehensive table of con                                   tents and document index so that readers can find the information that they need                       43 requirements                      specification                                   requirements  specification   is the  process of  writing   down  the user  and system                                   requirements in a requirements document ideally the user and system requirements                                   should be clear unambiguous easy to understand complete and consistent in prac                                   tice this is difficult   to achieve as stakeholders interpret the requirements in different                                   ways and there are often inherent conflicts and inconsistencies in the requirements                                       the  user  requirements  for  a system  should  describe the  functional   and non                                   functional requirements so that they are understandable by system users who dont have                                   detailed technical knowledge ideally they should specify only the external behavior of                                   the system the requirements document should not include details of the system archi                                   tecture or design consequently if you are writing user requirements you should not                                   use software jargon structured notations or formal notations you should write  user                                   requirements in natural language with simple tables forms and intuitive diagrams                                       system requirements are expanded versions of the user requirements that are used                                   by software engineers as the starting point for the system design they add detail and                                   explain how the  user requirements should be provided by the system they  may be                                   used as part of the contract for  the implementation  of the system and should there                                   fore be a complete and detailed specification of the whole system                                       ideally   the system requirements  should simply   describe the external  behavior                                    of the system and its

write requirements for software since the beginningfor the insulin pumpsoftware system         of software engineering it is expressive intuitive and universal it is  also potentially                                   vague ambiguous and its meaning depends on the background of  the reader as a                                   result there have been many proposals for  alternative  ways to write  requirements                                   however none of these have been widely adopted and natural language will continue                                   to be the most widely used way of specifying system and software requirements                                        to minimize   misunderstandings  when writing   natural  language requirements                                   i recommend that you follow  some simple guidelines                                   1 invent    a  standard format and ensure that all  requirement  definitions  adhere to                                          that format  standardizing the format  makes omissions less likely  and require                                          ments easier to check  the format  i use expresses the requirement in  a single                                          sentence i  associate a statement of  rationale  with   each user requirement  to                                          explain why  the requirement has been proposed the rationale may also include                                          information  on who  proposed the requirement the requirement source so that                                          you know whom  to consult if  the requirement has to be changed                                   2 use    language  consistently   to distinguish   between  mandatory  and desirable                                          requirements mandatory  requirements  are requirements that the  system must                                          support and  are usually  written  using  shall  desirable  requirements  are not                                          essential and are written using should                                   3 use   text highlighting  bold italic or color to pick out key parts of the requirement                                   4 do    not assume that readers understand technical software engineering language                                          it  is easy for words  like architecture   and module  to  be misunderstood you                                          should therefore avoid the use of jargon abbreviations and acronyms                                   5 whenever     possible  you  should  try  to  associate a  rationale  with   each user                                          requirement   the  rationale  should   explain  why   the requirement   has  been                                          included it  is particularly  useful when requirements are changed as it may help                                          decide what changes would be undesirable                                        figure 49 illustrates  how these guidelines may be used it includes two  require

                      requirements may be documented in  a completely  different  way eg  in a spread                                   sheet or on cards writing  requirements on cards can be very effective as these are                                   easy for stakeholders to handle change and organize120                                                                               45 \\x02

 requirements discovery sometime called requirements elicitation  is the process of                              gathering information  about the required system and existing systems and distilling                              the user and system requirements from this information sources of information dur                              ing the requirements  discovery phase include documentation

through managers to external stake                              holders such as regulators who certify the acceptability of  the system for example                              system stakeholders for the mental healthcare patient information system include                              1 patients   whose information  is recorded in  the system                              2 doctors    who are

              in  addition  to system stakeholders we have already seen that requirements may                              also come from the application domain and from  other systems that interact

         different ways however their  perspectives are not completely independent but usu                                   ally overlap  so that they have common requirements you can use these viewpoints                                   to structure both the discovery and the documentation of the system requirements                    452 interviewing                                   formal or  informal  interviews   with  system stakeholders are part  of most  require                                   ments engineering processes in these interviews the requirements engineering team                                   puts questions to stakeholders about the system that they currently  use and the sys                                   tem to be developed requirements are derived from the answers to these questions                                   interviews may be of two  types                                   1 closed    interviews where the stakeholder answers a predefined set of questions                                   2 open    interviews   in which  there  is no predefined  agenda the  requirements                                          engineering team explores a range of issues with system stakeholders and hence                                          develop a better understanding of their needs                                       in  practice interviews  with stakeholders are normally a mixture  of both of  these                                   you may have to obtain the answer to certain questions but these usually lead on to                                   other issues that are discussed in a less structured way completely openended dis                                   cussions rarely work well  you usually have to ask some questions to get started and                                   to keep the interview focused on the system to be developed                                       interviews  are good for getting an overall understanding of  what stakeholders do                                   how they might  interact with the new system and the difficulties  that they face with                                   current systems people  like  talking  about their  work  so are usually  happy  to get                                   involved in  interviews  however interviews are not so helpful  in  understanding the                                   requirements from the application  domain                                       it  can be difficult  to elicit  domain knowledge through interviews  for two  reasons                                   1 all      application  specialists  use terminology   and jargon  that  are specific  to  a                                          domain it is  impossible for them to discuss domain requirements without  using                                          this terminology   they normally  use terminology   in a  precise and subtle way                                          that is easy for requirements engineers to misunderstand                                   2 some    domain knowledge  is so  familiar  to stakeholders that  they either find  it                                          difficult  to explain  or they think  it is so fundamental that it isnt  worth mention                                          ing for example for  a librarian  it goes without  saying that all acquisitions  are                                          catalogued before they are added to the library however this may not  be obvi                                          ous to the interviewer and so it isnt  taken into account in the requirements                                       interviews  are also not an effective technique for eliciting  knowledge about orga                                   nizational requirements and constraints because there are subtle power relationships                                   between the different people in the organization published organizational structures122                                                               45 \\x02 requirements    elicitation  and  analysis 105              rarely match the reality  of decision making  in an organization but interviewees may              not wish to reveal the actual rather than the theoretical structure to a stranger in gen              eral most  people  are generally  reluctant  to  discuss political    and organizational              issues that may affect the requirements                  effective  interviewers have two characteristics              1 they    are openminded avoid  preconceived ideas about the requirements and                     are willing  to listen to stakeholders if  the stakeholder comes up with surprising                     requirements then they are willing  to change their mind about the system              2 they    prompt the interviewee to get discussions going using a springboard question                     a requirements proposal or by working together on a prototype system saying to                     people tell me what you want is unlikely to result in useful information they find                     it much easier to talk in a defined context rather than in general terms                  information  from  interviews supplements other information about the system from              documentation describing business processes or existing systems user observations              etc sometimes apart from the information   in the system documents the interview              information  may be the only  source of information   about the system requirements              however interviewing   on its  own is  liable to  miss essential information   and so it              should be used in conjunction with other requirements elicitation techniques453 scenarios              people usually   find  it  easier to  relate  to reallife   examples  rather  than  abstract              descriptions they can understand and criticize a scenario of how they might interact              with  a software  system requirements  engineers can  use the information   gained              from this discussion to formulate  the actual system requirements                  scenarios can be particularly  useful  for adding  detail to an outline  requirements              description  they are descriptions  of  example interaction  sessions each scenario              usually covers  one or a small  number  of possible  interactions  different  forms  of              scenarios are developed and they provide different types of  information  at different              levels of  detail  about the system  the stories used  in extreme  programming  dis              cussed in chapter 3 are a type of requirements scenario                  a  scenario starts with an outline of the interaction during  the elicitation  process              details are added to this  to create a complete description  of  that interaction  at  its              most general a scenario may include              1 a    description  of what the system and users expects when the scenario starts              2 a    description  of the normal flow  of events in the scenario              3 a    description  of what can go wrong and how this is  handled              4 information     about other

tional context  and software system requirements may  be derived or constrained by                                   that context satisfying  these social and organizational requirements is often critical                                   for the success of the system one reason why many software systems are delivered                                   but never used is that their requirements do not take proper account of how the social                                   and organizational context affects the practical operation of  the system

made of  the actual  tasks in                                   which  participants are involved  the value of  ethnography is  that it  helps discover                                   implicit

   people often find  it very  difficult   to articulate details  of their  work  because it is                                   second nature to them they understand their own work  but may  not

are not obvious  to individuals   may only  become clear                                   when noticed by an unbiased observer for example a work group may selforganize

martin  and sommerville 2004                                        ethnography is particularly  effective for  discovering two types of requirements                                   1 requirements     that are derived  from  the way  in  which  people actually   work                                          rather than  the way in  which  process definitions  say they  ought to  work  for                                          example  air  traffic   controllers   may  switch  off  a conflict    alert  system that                                          detects  aircraft  with   intersecting   flight   paths  even though  normal  control                                          procedures specify  that  it  should  be used they  deliberately  put  the aircraft                                          on conflicting   paths for  a short  time to  help manage the airspace their  con                                          trol  strategy is  designed to ensure that these aircrafts  are moved  apart before                                          problems occur  and they find  that the conflict   alert alarm  distracts them from                                          their  work                                   2 requirements    that are derived from cooperation and awareness of other peoples                                          activities  for  example air  traffic  controllers  may  use an awareness of other                                          controllers  work  to  predict the  number of  aircrafts that  will  be entering  their                                          control  sector they then modify their  control  strategies depending on that pre                                          dicted workload  therefore an automated atc system should allow controllers                                          in a sector to have some visibility  of the work  in adjacent sectors                                        ethnography can be combined with  prototyping  figure  416 the ethnography                                   informs the development of  the prototype so that fewer prototype  refinement cycles                                   are required furthermore  the prototyping  focuses the ethnography  by identifying                                   problems and questions that can then be discussed with the ethnographer he or she                                   should then look for  the answers to these questions during the next phase of the sys                                   tem study sommerville  et al 1993                                        ethnographic studies can reveal critical   process details that are often missed by                                   other requirements   elicitation   techniques  however  because of its  focus  on the                                   enduser this approach is not always appropriate  for  discovering organizational  or                                   domain  requirements  they  cannot always  identify   new  features that  should  be                                   added to a system ethnography  is  not therefore  a complete  approach to elicita

engineering                   requirements reviews     a requirements review is a process where a group of people from the system customer and the system     developer read the requirements document in detail and check for errors anomalies and inconsistencies once     these have been detected and recorded it is then up to the customer and the developer to negotiate how the     identified problems should be solved                            httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebrequirementsreviewshtml                      46 requirements                       validation                                   requirements validation is the process of checking that requirements actually define                                   the system that the customer really wants it overlaps with analysis as it is concerned                                   with  finding  problems with  the requirements requirements validation  is important                                   because errors in a requirements document can lead to extensive rework costs when                                   these problems are discovered during development or after the system is in service                                       the  cost of fixing  a requirements problem by making  a system change is usually                                   much greater than  repairing  design or  coding  errors the reason for  this  is that  a                                   change to the requirements usually  means that the system design and implementa                                   tion must also be changed furthermore the system must then be retested                                       during   the requirements validation  process different types  of checks should be                                   carried out on

used                                   individually  or in  conjunction with  one another                                   1 requirements    reviews the requirements are analyzed systematically by  a team                                          of reviewers who check for  errors and inconsistencies                                   2 prototyping in     this approach to validation an executable model of the system in                                          question is demonstrated to endusers and customers they can experiment with                                          this model to see if it  meets their real needs                                   3 testcase    generation requirements    should  be  testable  if  the  tests for   the                                          requirements  are devised as part  of the  validation  process this  often  reveals                                          requirements problems if  a test is difficult  or impossible to  design this usually                                          means that the requirements will be difficult  to  implement and should be recon                                          sidered developing tests from the user requirements before any code is written                                          is an integral part of extreme programming                                        you should not underestimate the problems involved  in requirements  validation                                   ultimately  it is difficult   to show that a set of requirements does in fact meet a users                                   needs users need to picture the system in  operation and imagine  how that  system                                   would  fit into  their  work  it is  hard even for skilled  computer professionals  to per                                   form this  type of abstract analysis and harder still for  system users as a result you                                   rarely find  all requirements problems  during the requirements validation  process it                                   is inevitable that there will  be further requirements changes to correct omissions and                                   misunderstandings after the requirements document has been agreed upon                       47 requirements                      management                                   the requirements for large software systems are always changing one reason for this is                                   that these systems are usually developed to address wicked problems—problems that                                   cannot be completely defined because the problem cannot be fully defined the soft                                   ware requirements are bound to be incomplete

with fundamental work activities volatile requirements are more likely to change they are usually associated with     supporting activities that reflect how the organization does its work rather than the work itself                         httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebrequirementsenduringreqhtml                                       once a system has been installed and is regularly used new requirements inevitably                                   emerge it is hard for  users and system customers to anticipate what effects the new                                   system will have on their business processes and the way that work is done once end                                   users have experience of a system they will discover new needs and priorities there                                   are several reasons why change is inevitable                                   1 the    business and  technical  environment  of  the system always  changes after                                          installation  new hardware may be introduced it  may be necessary to interface                                          the system with other systems business priorities may change with consequent                                          changes in the  system support required  and new  legislation  and regulations                                          may be introduced that the system must necessarily abide by                                   2 the    people  who pay  for  a system and the users of  that system  are rarely  the                                          same people system customers impose requirements because of organizational                                          and budgetary constraints these may conflict  with  enduser requirements and                                          after delivery new features may have to be added for user support if the system                                          is to meet its goals                                   3 large    systems usually have a diverse user community with  many users having                                          different  requirements and  priorities  that may  be conflicting   or contradictory                                          the final  system requirements are inevitably  a compromise between them and                                          with experience it is often discovered that the balance of support given to differ                                          ent users has to be changed                                       requirements   management  is  the process  of  understanding   and controlling                                   changes to system requirements you need to keep track of individual  requirements                                   and maintain   links  between  dependent requirements  so  that you  can  assess the                                   impact of  requirements changes you need to establish a formal process for making                                   change proposals and linking  these to system requirements the formal  process of                                   requirements management should start as soon as a

traceability     you need to keep track of the relationships between requirements their sources and the system design so      that you can analyze the reasons for proposed changes and the impact that these changes are likely to have on     other parts of the system you need to be able to trace how a change ripples its way through the system why                       httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebrequirementsreqtraceabilityhtml                                   using a formal process for change management is that all change proposals are treated                                   consistently and changes to the requirements document are made in a controlled way                                       there are three principal  stages to a change management process                                   1 problem    analysis and change specification the process starts with an identified                                          requirements problem  or sometimes with  a specific  change proposal during                                          this  stage the problem  or the change proposal  is analyzed  to check  that it  is                                          valid this  analysis is fed back to the change requestor who may respond with a                                          more specific requirements change proposal or decide to withdraw  the request                                   2 change    analysis  and  costing the  effect  of  the proposed  change is  assessed                                          using traceability   information   and general  knowledge  of the  system require                                          ments the cost of  making  the change is estimated both in  terms of  modifica                                          tions to the requirements document and if appropriate to the system design and                                          implementation  once this analysis is completed a decision is made whether or                                          not to proceed with the requirements change                                   3 change    implementation the  requirements document and where necessary the                                          system  design and  implementation   are modified   you  should  organize  the                                          requirements document  so that you  can make changes to it  without  extensive                                          rewriting  or  reorganization  as with  programs  changeability  in documents  is                                          achieved by minimizing   external references and making the document sections                                          as modular as possible thus individual  sections can be changed and replaced                                          without  affecting other parts of the document                                       if  a new requirement has to be urgently implemented there is always a temptation to                                   change the system and then retrospectively modify the requirements document you                                   should try to avoid this as it almost inevitably leads to the requirements specification and                                   the system implementation getting out of step once system changes have been made it                                   is easy to forget to include these changes in the requirements document or to add infor                                   mation to the requirements document that is inconsistent with the implementation                                       agile  development processes such as extreme programming have been designed                                   to cope with   requirements  that change during  the  development process  in these                                   processes when a user proposes a requirements  change this  change does not go                                   through a formal  change management process rather the user has to prioritize that                                   change and if it is high priority decide what system features that were planned for the                                   next iteration should be dropped132

objectives            the aim of this chapter is to introduce some types of system model            that may be developed as part of the requirements engineering and            system design processes when you have read the chapter you will            \\x02 understand how graphical models can be used to represent                software systems            \\x02 understand why different types of model are required and the                fundamental system modeling perspectives of context interaction                structure and behavior            \\x02 have been introduced to some of the diagram types in the unified                modeling language uml and how these diagrams may be used in                system modeling            \\x02 be aware of the ideas underlying modeldriven

system   modeling 119system modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system with eachmodel presenting a different  view  or  perspective of that  system system modelinghas generally come to mean representing the  system using some kind  of graphicalnotation which  is now  almost always  based on notations in  the unified  modelinglanguage uml   however  it  is also possible  to develop  formal  mathematicalmodels of  a system usually  as a detailed  system specification   i cover  graphicalmodeling using the uml  in  this chapter and formal modeling in  chapter 12    models  are used during the requirements engineering  process to help derive therequirements for a system during the design process to describe the system to engineers implementing the system and after implementation  to  document the systemsstructure and operation you may develop models of both the existing system and thesystem to be developed1 models    of  the existing system are used during requirements engineering  they       help clarify   what the existing  system does and can be used as a basis for  dis       cussing its strengths and weaknesses these then lead to requirements  for the       new system2 models     of the  new system are used during  requirements  engineering  to help       explain the proposed requirements to other system stakeholders engineers use       these models to discuss design proposals and to document the system for imple       mentation in  a modeldriven  engineering  process it is  possible to generate a       complete or partial system implementation  from the system model    the most important  aspect of a system model is that it leaves out detail a modelis an abstraction of the system being studied rather than an alternative representationof that system ideally a representation of a system should maintain all the information about  the entity  being represented an  abstraction deliberately  simplifies  andpicks out the most salient characteristics for example in  the very unlikely  event ofthis book being serialized in a newspaper the presentation there would be an abstraction of  the books  key  points  if  it were  translated from  english  into  italian   thiswould be an alternative representation the translators intention  would  be to maintain all the information  as it is presented in english    you may develop different  models to represent the system from different perspectives for example1 an    external perspective where you model the context or environment of the system2 an    interaction  perspective where you model  the interactions between a system       and its environment or between the components of a system3 a    structural  perspective where you  model the organization  of a system or  the       structure of the data that is processed by the system4 a    behavioral perspective where you model the dynamic behavior  of the system       and how it responds to events137120 chapter    5 \\x02 system    modeling                                       these perspectives have much in common with  krutchens 4  + 1 view of  system                                   architecture kruchten  1995 where  he suggests that you should document a  sys                                   tems architecture and organization  from different  perspectives i discuss this 4  + 1                                   approach in chapter 6                                       in  this chapter i  use diagrams defined in  uml  booch  et al 2005  rumbaugh                                   et al 2004  which  has become a standard modeling language for  objectoriented                                   modeling the  uml  has many diagram types and so supports the creation of many                                   different  types of  system model  however  a survey  in 2007  erickson  and siau                                   2007 showed  that most users of  the uml   thought  that five  diagram  types could                                   represent the essentials of a system                                   1 activity      diagrams which  show  the activities  involved  in  a process or in  data                                          processing                                   2 use    case diagrams which show the interactions between a system and its envi

system components                                   4 class    diagrams which  show the  object classes in the system  and the associa                                          tions between these classes                                   5 state   diagrams which show how the system reacts to internal and external events                                       as  i do not  have space to discuss all of the uml  diagram types here i  focus on                                   how these five key types of diagram are used in system modeling                                       when  developing  system models you  can often be flexible   in the way  that the                                   graphical notation is used you do not always need to stick rigidly   to the details of a                                   notation the detail and rigor  of a model depends on how you intend to use it there                                   are three ways in which graphical models are commonly  used                                   1 as    a means of facilitating  discussion about an existing or proposed system                                   2 as    a way of documenting  an existing system                                   3 as     a  detailed   system  description   that  can  be  used to  generate  a  system                                          implementation                                       in   the  first   case the  purpose  of  the  model   is  to  stimulate   the  discussion                                   amongst the  software  engineers involved   in developing  the  system the  models                                   may be  incomplete  so long  as they  cover the  key points  of  the  discussion  and                                   they may use the modeling  notation  informally   this  is how  models are normally                                   used in socalled  agile  modeling  ambler   and jeffries 2002  when models  are                                   used as documentation they  do not have to  be complete as you may  only  wish to                                   develop  models for  some  parts of  a system  however  these models  have to  be                                   correct—they  should  use the notation  correctly  and be an accurate description  of                                   the system138                                                                                                                   51 \\x02 context    models 121              the unified modeling languagethe unified modeling language is a set of 13 different diagram types that may be used to model softwaresystems it emerged from work in the 1990s on objectoriented modeling where similar objectorientednotations were integrated to create the uml a major revision uml 2 was finalized in 2004 the uml isuniversally accepted as the standard approach for developing models of software systems variants have beenproposed for more general system modeling                                        httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebuml                                   in the third  case where models are used as part of  a modelbased development                              process the system models have to be both complete and correct the reason for this                              is  that  they  are used  as a basis  for  generating  the  source  code of   the system                              therefore you have to be very careful  not to confuse similar  symbols such as stick                              and block arrowheads that have different meanings                   51 context               models                              at  an early stage in the specification  of a system you  should decide on the system                              boundaries this  involves working   with  system stakeholders to decide  what func                              tionality  should be included in the system and what is provided by the systems envi                              ronment  you  may  decide that  automated  support  for  some  business processes                              should be implemented but  others should be manual processes or supported by dif                              ferent systems you should  look  at possible overlaps in  functionality   with  existing                              systems and decide where  new functionality   should  be implemented  these deci                              sions should  be made early  in  the process to  limit  the  system costs and the  time                              needed for understanding the system requirements and design                                   in some cases the boundary between a system and its environment  is relatively                              clear for example where  an automated system is replacing  an existing manual  or                              computerized system the environment of  the new system is usually the same as the                              existing  systems  environment  in  other cases there  is more  flexibility    and you                              decide what constitutes the boundary between the system and its environment during                              the requirements engineering process                                   for example say you are developing the specification for  the patient information                              system for mental healthcare this  system is intended to manage information  about                              patients attending mental health clinics and the treatments that have been prescribed                              in developing  the specification for  this system you have to decide whether the sys                              tem should  focus exclusively  on collecting  information   about consultations  using                              other systems to  collect personal  information  about  patients or whether  it  should                              also collect personal patient information  the advantage of relying  on other systems                              for  patient information  is  that you avoid  duplicating  data the major disadvantage                              however is that  using other  systems may make it  slower to  access information  if                              these systems are unavailable then the mhcpms cannot be used139122 chapter    5 \\x02 system    modeling                                                                                                «system»

section i cover two  related approaches to interaction modeling                                   1 use    case modeling   which  is  mostly   used to model  interactions   between  a                                          system and external actors users or other systems                                   2 sequence    diagrams  which   are used to  model  interactions   between system                                          components although external agents may also be included                                       use case models and sequence diagrams present interaction at different levels of                                   detail and so may be used together the details of the interactions involved in a high                                   level use case may be documented in a sequence diagram the uml  also includes                                   communication  diagrams  that  can be used to  model interactions   i dont  discuss                                   these here as they are an alternative representation of sequence charts in fact some                                   tools can generate a communication diagram from a sequence diagram

directions however the arrows in figure 53 are                                   used informally  to indicate that the medical receptionist  initiates the transaction and                                   data is transferred to the patient record system                                        use case diagrams give a fairly simple overview  of an interaction  so you have to                                   provide more detail to understand what is involved this detail can either be a simple                                   textual description a structured description  in a table or a sequence

 is  required in the  model i  find  a standard tabular                                   format to be the most useful figure  54 shows a tabular description of the transfer

sometimes it is possible to  include all  possible interactions                                   with a system in a single composite use case diagram however this may be impos

diagrams                                   sequence diagrams in the uml are primarily used to model the interactions between                                   the actors and the objects in a system and the interactions between the objects them                                   selves the uml  has a rich syntax for  sequence diagrams which allows many  dif                                   ferent kinds of interaction  to be modeled i dont have space to cover all possibilities                                   here so i focus on the basics of this diagram type                                       as  the name implies a sequence diagram shows the sequence of interactions that                                   take place during a particular use case or use case instance figure 56 is an example                                   of a sequence diagram that illustrates the basics of the notation this diagram models                                   the interactions involved  in the view  patient information  use case where a medical                                   receptionist can see some patient information                                       the objects and actors involved are listed along the top of the diagram with a dot                                   ted line  drawn vertically  from  these interactions  between objects are indicated by                                   annotated arrows the rectangle on the dotted lines indicates the lifeline of the object                                   concerned ie the  time that  object instance is  involved  in the  computation  you                                   read the sequence of interactions from top to bottom the annotations on the arrows                                   indicate the calls to the

     illustrates two  additional  features these are the direct communication between the                                   actors in the system and the creation of objects as part of a sequence of operations in                                   this example an object of type summary is created to hold the summary data that is to                                   be uploaded to the prs patient record system you can read this diagram as follows                                   1 the    receptionist logs on to the prs                                   2 there     are two  options  available  these allow  the  direct  transfer  of  updated                                          patient information  to the prs and the transfer of summary health data from the                                          mhcpms  to the prs                                   3 in    each case the receptionists permissions are checked using the authorization                                          system

may be created from the database                                          and that record is then transferred                                   5 on    completion   of the  transfer the  prs issues a

the classes in a system and the associations between these classes loosely an object                              class can be thought of as a general definition of one kind of system object an asso                              ciation  is a link  between classes that indicates  that there is a  relationship between                              these classes consequently each class may  have to have some  knowledge of  its                              associated class                                   when you  are developing models  during  the early stages of  the software  engi

at different levels of detail when you                              are developing a  model the first  stage is usually  to look  at the world  identify   the                              essential objects and represent these as classes the simplest way of writing these is to                              write the class name in a box you can also simply note the existence of an association147130

    by drawing a line between classes for example figure 58 is a simple class diagram                                   showing two classes patient and patient record with an association between them                                        in figure 58 i  illustrate  a further feature of class diagrams—the ability  to  show                                   how many objects  are involved in  the association in this  example each end of the                                   association is annotated with  a 1 meaning  that there is a 11  relationship  between                                   objects of these classes that is each patient has exactly one record and each record                                   maintains information   about exactly one  patient as  you can see from  later exam                                   ples other multiplicities  are possible you can define that an exact number of objects                                   are involved or by using a  as shown in figure 59 that there are an indefinite num                                   ber of objects involved in  the association                                        figure 59 develops this type of class diagram to show that objects of class patient                                   are also involved in  relationships with  a number of other  classes in this example i                                   show that you can name associations to give the reader an indication  of  the type of                                   relationship that exists the uml   also allows the role of the objects participating  in                                   the association to be specified                                        at this  level of  detail class diagrams look  like  semantic data models semantic                                   data models are used in database design they show the data entities their associated                                   attributes and the relations  between these entities this approach to modeling  was                                   first  proposed in the mid1970s  by chen  1976 several variants have been devel                                   oped since then codd 1979 hammer and mcleod 1981 hull and king  1987 all                                   with the same basic form                                        the uml   does not include  a specific  notation for  this  database modeling as it                                   assumes an objectoriented development process and models data using objects and                                   their  relationships  however  you can  use the uml   to represent  a semantic data                                   model you can think of entities in a semantic data model as simplified object

things that you  can request from an object  for example a patient object  will                                   have the attribute address and you may include an operation called changeaddress                                   which is  called when a patient  indicates that they have moved from  one address to                                   another in the  uml  you  show attributes  and operations by extending  the simple                                   rectangle that represents a class this is illustrated in figure 510 where                                   1 the    name of the

                               if  there is scope for  generalization  this  means that common  information   will  be                                   maintained  in  one  place only  this  is  good  design  practice  as it  means that  if                                   changes are proposed then you do not  have to look  at all  classes in the system to                                   see if

in  figure 511  the generalization  is shown as an arrowhead pointing  up  to                                   the more general  class this shows that  general practitioners  and hospital  doctors                                   can be generalized as doctors  and that there are three  types of  hospital  doctor—                                   those that  have just  graduated  from   medical  school  and have  to be  supervised                                   trainee doctor  those that  can work  unsupervised as part of  a consultants team                                   registered

attributes  and operations  associated with   higherlevel                                   classes are also associated with the lowerlevel  classes in essence the lowerlevel                                   classes are subclasses inherit the attributes and operations from  their  superclasses                                   these lowerlevel   classes then add  more specific   attributes  and operations  for                                   example all doctors have a name and phone number all hospital doctors have a staff                                   number and a department but general practitioners dont have these attributes as they                                   work  independently they  do however have a  practice name and address this  is

functional perspective where each transformation     represents a single function or process dfds are used to show how data flows through a sequence of processing     steps for example a processing step could be the filtering of duplicate records in a customer database the data     is transformed at each step before moving on to the next stage these processing steps or transformations     represent software processes or functions where dataflow diagrams are used to document a software design                                               httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebdfds                                        many business systems are data processing systems that are primarily driven by                                   data they are controlled by the data input to the system with relatively little  external                                   event processing their processing involves a sequence of actions on that data and the                                   generation of an output for example a phone billing system will  accept information                                   about calls made by a customer calculate the costs of these calls and generate a bill                                   to be sent to that customer by contrast realtime systems are often event driven with                                   minimal data processing for example a landline phone switching system responds to                                   events such as receiver off hook by generating a dial tone or the pressing of keys on                                   a handset by capturing the phone number etc                     541 datadriven           modeling                                   datadriven models show the sequence of actions involved  in processing input  data                                   and generating an associated output they are particularly useful during the analysis                                   of requirements as they can be used to show endtoend processing in a system that                                   is they  show the  entire  sequence of actions  that take  place from  an  input  being                                   processed to the corresponding output which is the systems response                                        datadriven  models were  amongst  the first  graphical  software  models  in  the                                   1970s structured methods such as demarcos structured analysis demarco 1978                                   introduced dataflow  diagrams dfds  as a way of illustrating   the processing steps                                   in a system dataflow models are useful because tracking and documenting how the                                   data associated with a particular  process moves through  the system helps analysts                                   and designers understand what is going on dataflow diagrams are simple and intu                                   itive and it is usually possible to explain them to potential  system users who can then                                   participate in validating  the model                                        the uml does not support dataflow diagrams as they were originally proposed and                                   used for modeling data processing the reason for this is that dfds focus on system                                   functions and do not recognize system objects however because datadriven systems                                   are so common in business uml 20 introduced activity diagrams which are similar to                                   dataflow diagrams for example figure 514 shows the chain of processing involved in                                   the insulin pump  software in this  diagram you can see the processing steps repre                                   sented as activities and the data flowing between these steps represented as objects                                        an alternative way of showing the sequence of processing in a system is to use uml                                   sequence diagrams you have seen how these can be used to model interaction but if152                                                                                                                   54 \\x02 behavioral    models 135

 models one way to do this is by using the notion  of a superstate that encapsulates a                                   number of  separate states this superstate looks like  a single state on a highlevel                                   model but is then expanded to show more detail on a separate diagram to illustrate                                   this concept consider the operation state in figure 515 this is a superstate that can                                   be expanded as illustrated in figure 518                                        the operation state includes a number of substates it shows that operation starts                                   with a status check and that if any problems are discovered an alarm is indicated and

                       modeldriven engineering mde is an approach to software development where mod                                   els rather than programs are the principal outputs of the development process kent                                   2002 schmidt 2006 the programs that execute on a hardwaresoftware platform are                                   then generated automatically from the models proponents of mde argue that this raises                                   the level of abstraction in software engineering so that engineers no longer have to be                                   concerned with programming language details or the specifics of execution platforms                                        modeldriven engineering has its roots in modeldriven architecture mda  which                                   was proposed by the object management group omg  in  2001 as a new software                                   development paradigm modeldriven engineering and modeldriven architecture are                                   often seen as the same thing  however  i think  that  mde  has a wider  scope than156

software development whereas mde is  concerned with all  aspects of             the software  engineering  process therefore topics  such as modelbased require             ments engineering  software processes for  modelbased development and  model             based testing are part of mde but not currently part of mda                  although mda   has been in use since 2001 modelbased engineering is still at an             early stage of development and it is  unclear whether or not it  will  have a significant             effect on software engineering practice the main arguments for and against mde are             1 for    mde modelbased  engineering allows engineers to think about systems at a                    high  level of  abstraction without  concern  for the  details of  their implementa                    tion  this reduces the likelihood  of errors speeds up the design and implemen                    tation  process and allows  for  the creation  of  reusable platformindependent                    application  models  by  using powerful  tools  system implementations  can be                    generated for different  platforms  from the  same model therefore to adapt the                    system to some new platform technology it  is only necessary to write a transla                    tor  for  that platform  when  this is available  all  platformindependent  models                    can be rapidly rehosted on the new platform             2 against     mde as  i  discussed earlier in this  chapter models are a good way of                    facilitating   discussions about  a software design  however it  does not always                    follow  that the abstractions that are supported by the model are the right abstrac                    tions  for implementation  so you  may create informal  design models but then                    go  on to implement  the  system using  an offtheshelf  configurable   package                    furthermore  the arguments for platform  independence are only valid  for large                    longlifetime   systems where the platforms  become obsolete during  a systems                    lifetime  however for this  class of systems we know that implementation is not                    the major problem—requirements  engineering security and dependability inte                    gration with  legacy systems and testing are more significant                  there have been significant mde  success stories reported by the omg  on their             web pages wwwomgorgmdaproductssuccesshtm    and the  approach is  used             within  large companies such as ibm and siemens the techniques have been used suc             cessfully in the development of large longlifetime software systems such as air traffic             management systems nevertheless at the time of writing modeldriven approaches             are not widely  used for software engineering like formal  methods of software engi             neering which i  discuss in chapter 12 i believe that mde  is  an important develop             ment however as is also the  case with formal  methods it is  not clear whether the             costs and risks of modeldriven approaches outweigh the possible benefits551 modeldriven           architecture             modeldriven

                                  you may develop  several different cims  reflecting  different  views  of the sys                                          tem for example there may be a security cim in  which you identify  important                                          security  abstractions such as an asset and a role and a patient  record cim  in                                          which you  describe abstractions such as patients consultations etc                                   2 a     platform  independent model pim   that models the operation  of the system                                          without  reference  to its  implementation  the  pim  is usually  described  using                                          uml  models that show the static system structure

layers of  psm with  each layer adding  some platform                                          specific   detail  so  the  firstlevel    psm  could  be  middlewarespecific    but

       as  i have said transformations between these models may be defined and applied                                   automatically  by software tools this  is illustrated in  figure 519 which  also shows                                   a final level  of automatic transformation  a transformation  is applied to  the psm to                                   generate executable code that

the translation  of pims to psms is more mature and several commercial tools are                                   available that provide translators from  pims  to common platforms  such as java and                                   j2ee these rely on  an extensive library  of  platformspecific  rules and patterns to                                   convert the pim to the psm there may be several psms for each pim in the system                                   if a software system is intended to run on different  platforms eg j2ee and net                                   then it is only  necessary to maintain the pim the psms for each platform  are auto                                   matically  generated this is illustrated in figure 520                                       although   mdasupport   tools  include  platformspecific    translators  it is  often                                   the case that these will  only  offer  partial  support for  the translation  from  pims  to                                   psms in  the  vast majority   of  cases the execution  environment   for  a system is                                   more  than  the  standard

therefore  when  mda  is                                   introduced  special purpose translators  may have to  be created that take the char                                   acteristics  of  the

                modeldriven engineering  the developers of mda  claim  that it  is intended to sup                                   port an iterative  approach to development and so can be used within agile  methods                                   mellor  et al  2004 if  transformations  can be completely  automated and a com                                   plete program generated from  a pim  then in principle  mda   could be used in  an                                   agile development process as no separate coding would be required however as far                                   as i am aware there are no mda tools that support practices such as regression test                                   ing and testdriven development159142 chapter    5 \\x02 system    modeling                     552 executable          uml                                   the fundamental notion behind modeldriven engineering is that completely automated                                   transformation of models to code should be possible to achieve this you have to be                                   able to construct graphical models whose semantics are well defined you also need a                                   way of adding information to graphical models about the ways in which the operations                                   defined in the model are implemented this is possible using a subset of uml 2 called                                   executable uml   or xuml   mellor   and balcer 2002  i dont  have space here to                                   describe the details of xuml so i simply present a short overview of its main features                                        uml  was  designed as  a language for   supporting  and documenting   software                                   design not as a programming language the designers of uml  were not concerned                                   with  semantic details of  the language but with  its  expressiveness they introduced                                   useful notions such as use case diagrams that help with the design but which are too                                   informal  to support execution to create an executable subset of uml  the number                                   of model types has therefore been dramatically reduced to three key model types                                   1 domain    models identify  the principal  concerns in the system these are defined                                          using uml  class diagrams that include objects attributes

you have read the chapter            you will            \\x02 understand why the architectural design of software is important            \\x02 understand the decisions that have to be made about the system                architecture during the architectural design process            \\x02 have been introduced to the idea of architectural patterns welltried                ways of organizing

understanding  how  a  system should  be                                   organized and designing the overall structure of that system in the model of the soft                                   ware development process as shown in  chapter 2 architectural  design is  the first                                   stage in  the software   design process  it  is  the critical   link   between  design and                                   requirements engineering as it identifies the main structural components in a system                                   and the relationships between them the output of the architectural design process is                                   an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of commu                                   nicating components                                        in agile processes it is generally accepted that an early stage of the development                                   process should  be  concerned  with  establishing   an  overall  system  architecture                                   incremental development of  architectures is not usually  successful while  refactor                                   ing components in  response to changes is usually relatively easy refactoring a sys                                   tem architecture is likely  to be expensive                                        to help you understand what i mean by system architecture consider figure 61                                   this shows  an abstract model  of the  architecture for  a  packing robot  system that                                   shows the components that have to be developed this robotic system can pack dif                                   ferent kinds of  object it uses a vision component to pick  out objects on a conveyor                                   identify  the type of  object and select the right  kind  of packaging the system then                                   moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged it places packaged objects                                   on another conveyor the architectural model shows these components and the links                                   between them                                        in practice there is  a significant  overlap between the processes of requirements                                   engineering  and architectural   design  ideally  a system  specification   should  not                                   include  any design information   this is  unrealistic  except for  very small  systems                                   architectural  decomposition is usually  necessary to structure and organize the spec                                   ification  therefore as part of the requirements engineering process you might pro                                   pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of system functions                                   or features  with   largescale  components or  subsystems  you  can then  use this                                   decomposition  to discuss the requirements  and features of  the system

the components interoperate                                          the system architecture is often the same for systems with similar requirements                                          and so can support largescale software reuse as i explain in chapter 16 it may                                          be possible to develop productline architectures where the same architecture is                                          reused across a range of related systems167150 chapter    6 \\x02 architectural     design                                        hofmeister et al 2000 propose that a software architecture can serve firstly as a                                   design plan for the negotiation  of system requirements and secondly as a means of                                   structuring  discussions with  clients  developers and managers they also  suggest                                   that it is an essential tool for complexity  management it hides details and allows the                                   designers to focus on the key system abstractions                                        system architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams as in figure 61                                   each box in the diagram represents a component boxes within boxes indicate that the                                   component has been decomposed to subcomponents arrows mean that data and or con                                   trol signals are passed from component to component in the direction of the arrows you                                   can see many examples of this type of architectural model in boochs software architec                                   ture catalog booch 2009                                        block diagrams present a highlevel picture of the system structure which people                                   from different  disciplines  who are involved in the system development process can                                   readily understand however in spite of their  widespread use bass et al 2003 dis                                   like  informal  block  diagrams for  describing an  architecture they claim  that  these                                   informal  diagrams are poor  architectural  representations as they show neither  the                                   type of the relationships  among system components nor the components externally                                   visible properties                                        the apparent  contradictions   between  practice  and  architectural   theory  arise                                   because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a program is used                                   1 as     a way  of  facilitating    discussion   about  the  system design a   highlevel                                          architectural  view of  a system is useful for  communication  with  system stake                                          holders  and project   planning  because it  is  not cluttered   with  detail  stake                                          holders can  relate to  it  and understand an abstract  view  of the  system they                                          can then discuss the system as a whole  without  being confused by  detail the                                          architectural   model  identifies  the  key components  that  are to  be developed                                          so managers  can  start  assigning  people  to  plan  the  development  of  these                                          systems                                   2 as    a way of  documenting an architecture that  has been designed the aim here                                           is to  produce a complete system model that shows the different  components in                                          a system their  interfaces and their  connections the argument for  this  is that                                          such a detailed architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve                                          the system                                        block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system architecture dur                                   ing  the design  process  as they  are a good  way  of  supporting   communications                                   between the people  involved  in the process in  many projects  these are often  the                                   only architectural documentation that exists however if  the architecture of a system                                   is to be thoroughly  documented then it  is better to use a notation with  welldefined                                   semantics for architectural  description  however as i discuss in  section 62 some                                   people think that  detailed documentation is neither useful  nor really  worth the cost                                   of its development168                                                                        61 \\x02 architectural     design  decisions 15161 architectural                      design         decisions           architectural   design is a creative process where  you design a system organization           that will  satisfy the functional  and nonfunctional requirements of a system because           it is a creative process the activities within  the process depend on the type of system           being  developed the background  and experience of  the system  architect and  the           specific  requirements for  the system it  is therefore useful  to think  of  architectural           design as a series of decisions to be made rather than a sequence of activities                during  the architectural design process system architects have to make a number           of  structural   decisions  that  profoundly    affect  the  system  and  its  development           process based on their knowledge and experience they have to consider the follow           ing fundamental  questions about the system           1 is    there a generic application  architecture that can act as a template for the sys                  tem that is being designed           2 how     will  the system be distributed across a number of cores or processors           3 what     architectural patterns or styles might be used           4 what     will  be the fundamental approach used to structure the system           5 how     will   the structural   components in  the system  be decomposed into  sub                  components           6 what    strategy will be used to control the operation of the components in the system           7 what    architectural  organization is best for delivering the nonfunctional  require                  ments of the system           8 how     will  the architectural design be evaluated           9 how     should the architecture of the system be documented                although   each software   system  is  unique  systems in   the same  application           domain often  have similar architectures that reflect  the fundamental concepts of the           domain for example application  product lines are applications that are built around           a core architecture with  variants  that satisfy specific  customer requirements when           designing a system architecture  you have to decide what  your system and broader           application  classes have in common and  decide how much  knowledge from  these           application  architectures you can reuse i discuss generic application architectures in           section 64 and application product  lines in chapter 16                for embedded systems  and systems designed for  personal computers  there is           usually only  a single processor and you will not have to design a distributed architec           ture  for the  system however  most large  systems are now distributed   systems in           which  the  system software   is distributed   across many  different  computers  the           choice of  distribution  architecture is a key decision that affects the performance and169152 chapter    6 \\x02 architectural     design

list you have to choose                                   the most appropriate structure such as client–server or layered structuring that will                                   enable you to meet the system requirements to decompose structural system units                                   you decide on the strategy for  decomposing components into subcomponents the                                   approaches that you can use allow different types of architecture to be implemented                                   finally  in the control  modeling  process you make decisions about how the

architectural  style and structure that you choose for                                   a system should depend on the nonfunctional system requirements                                   1 performance if     performance  is a  critical  requirement  the architecture  should                                          be designed  to  localize  critical    operations  within   a small  number  of  com                                          ponents with these components all deployed on the same computer rather than                                          distributed across the network this may mean using a few relatively large com                                          ponents rather than small finegrain  components which reduces the number of                                          component communications  you may also consider runtime system organiza                                          tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed on different processors                                   2 security if     security is a critical  requirement a layered structure for the architec                                          ture should be used with the most critical  assets protected in the innermost lay                                          ers with a high level  of security validation  applied to these layers                                   3 safety if    safety is  a critical  requirement the architecture should be designed so                                          that safetyrelated operations are all located in either a single component or in a                                          small number of components this reduces the costs and problems of safety val                                          idation  and makes  it

availability if       availability   is a critical  requirement  the architecture  should be                                          designed to include  redundant components so that it is  possible to replace and                                          update components without  stopping  the system i  describe two  faulttolerant                                          system architectures for

      ture should  be designed using finegrain  selfcontained  components that may170                                                                                            62 \\x02 architectural    views 153                   readily  be changed producers of data should be separated from consumers and                   shared data structures should be avoided                 obviously  there is  potential  conflict  between  some of  these architectures for            example using large components improves performance and using small finegrain            components improves maintainability   if  both performance and maintainability   are            important  system requirements  then  some compromise  must be found  this  can            sometimes be achieved by using different architectural patterns or styles for different            parts of the system                 evaluating an architectural design is difficult   because the true test of an architec            ture is  how well  the  system meets its functional   and nonfunctional  requirements            when it  is in use however you  can do some evaluation by comparing  your design            against reference  architectures  or  generic architectural   patterns  boschs 2000            description of  the nonfunctional characteristics of  architectural patterns can also be            used to help with architectural  evaluation62 architectural                      views            i explained in the introduction  to this  chapter that architectural models of a software            system can be used to focus discussion about the  software requirements or design            alternatively  they may be used to document a design so that it can be used as a basis            for more detailed design and implementation and for the future evolution  of the sys            tem in this section i  discuss two issues that are relevant to both of these            1 what    views  or perspectives are useful when designing and documenting  a sys                   tems architecture            2 what    notations should be used for describing architectural  models                 it is impossible to represent all relevant information about a systems architecture in            a single architectural model as each model only shows one view or perspective of the            system it might  show how a system is decomposed into modules how the runtime            processes interact or the different ways in which  system components are distributed            across a network all of these are useful at different times so for both design and doc            umentation you usually need to present multiple views of the software architecture                 there are different  opinions as to  what views  are required krutchen  1995 in            his wellknown  4+1 view  model of  software architecture suggests that there should            be four fundamental architectural views which  are related using use cases or scenar            ios the views that he suggests are            1 a     logical  view  which  shows the key abstractions  in the  system as objects or                   object classes it should be possible to relate the system requirements to entities                   in this logical  view171154 chapter    6 \\x02 architectural     design                                   2 a    process view which shows how at runtime the system is composed of inter                                          acting   processes this   view   is  useful  for   making   judgments   about  non                                          functional  system characteristics such as performance and availability                                   3 a     development view which  shows how the software  is decomposed for devel                                          opment that is it shows the breakdown of the software into components that are                                          implemented by a single developer or development team this view is useful for                                          software managers and programmers                                   4 a     physical view  which shows the system hardware and how  software compo                                          nents are distributed across the processors in the system this view is useful for                                          systems engineers planning a system deployment                                        hofmeister et al 2000 suggest the use of similar views but add to this the notion                                   of a conceptual view this view is an abstract view of the system that can be the basis                                   for  decomposing  highlevel  requirements  into  more  detailed specifications   help                                   engineers make  decisions  about  components  that  can be  reused and  represent                                   a product  line  discussed in  chapter 16  rather than  a single  system figure  61                                   which  describes the architecture of a packing  robot is  an example of a  conceptual                                   system view                                        in practice  conceptual  views  are almost  always  developed during  the  design                                   process and are used to support  architectural decision  making  they are a  way of                                   communicating the essence of a system to different stakeholders during  the design                                   process some of the other views  may also be developed when  different  aspects of                                   the system are discussed but there is no need for a complete description from all per                                   spectives it may also be possible to associate architectural patterns discussed in the                                   next section with the different  views of a system                                        there are differing   views  about whether  or not  software architects  should  use                                   the uml   for  architectural  description  clements et  al 2002  a  survey in  2006                                   lange et al 2006 showed that when the uml  was used it was mostly  applied in                                   a loose and informal way the authors of that paper argued that this was a bad thing                                   i disagree  with  this view  the  uml  was  designed for  describing  objectoriented                                   systems and at the architectural design stage you often want to describe systems at                                   a higher level of abstraction object classes are too close to the implementation to be                                   useful for architectural  description                                        i dont find  the uml to be useful during the design process itself and prefer infor                                   mal notations  that are quicker to  write  and which  can be easily drawn  on a white                                   board the  uml   is of  most value  when you  are documenting   an architecture  in                                   detail or using modeldriven  development as discussed in chapter 5                                        a number of  researchers have proposed the use of more specialized architectural                                   description languages adls   bass et al 2003  to describe system architectures                                   the basic elements of adls  are components and connectors and they include rules                                   and guidelines for  wellformed  architectures however because of their specialized                                   nature domain and application specialists find  it  hard to understand and use adls                                   this makes it  difficult  to  assess their usefulness for practical software engineering                                   adls  designed for a particular domain eg automobile  systems may be used as a172                                                                                                              63 \\x02 architectural

                  three logical components that interact with each other the model component manages                                    the system data and associated operations on that data the view component defines and                                    manages how the data is presented to the user the controller component manages user                                    interaction eg key presses mouse clicks etc and passes these interactions to the view                                    and the model see figure 63    example                  figure 64 shows the architecture of a webbased application system organized using the                                    mvc pattern    when used             used when there are multiple ways to view and interact with data also used when the                                    future requirements for interaction and presentation of data are unknown    advantages             allows the data to change independently of its representation and vice versa supports                                    presentation of the same data in different ways with changes made in one representation                                    shown in all of them    disadvantages        can involve additional code and code complexity when the data model and interactions                                    are simple                                   basis for modeldriven  development  however i  believe that  informal  models andfigure 62 the modelviewcontroller mvc notations such as the uml   will  remain  the most commonly  used ways  of docupattern                       menting  system architectures                                       users  of  agile  methods  claim   that detailed   design  documentation  is  mostly                                   unused it is therefore a waste of time and money to develop it i largely agree with                                   this view  and i  think  that for  most  systems it is  not worth  developing  a detailed                                   architectural description from  these four perspectives you should develop the views                                   that are useful for communication and not worry  about whether or not your architec                                   tural  documentation  is complete  however  an exception  to  this is  when you  are                                   developing critical  systems when you need to make a detailed dependability analy                                   sis of  the system you may  need to convince  external regulators  that your  system                                   conforms to  their regulations  and so complete architectural  documentation may be                                   required                       63 architectural                      patterns                                   the idea of  patterns as a way of presenting sharing  and reusing knowledge about

    in this section  i introduce  architectural patterns and briefly  describe a selection                                   of architectural  patterns that are commonly  used in  different types  of systems for                                   more information  about patterns and their use you should refer to published pattern                                   handbooks                                        you can think of an architectural pattern as a stylized abstract description of good                                   practice which has been tried and tested in different systems and environments so                                   an architectural pattern should describe a system organization that has been success                                   ful in  previous systems it should include information  of when it  is and is not appro                                   priate to use that pattern and the patterns strengths and weaknesses                                        for example figure 62 describes the wellknown modelviewcontroller pattern                                   this pattern is the basis of interaction management in many webbased systems the                                   stylized  pattern description includes  the pattern name a brief  description  with  an                                   associated graphical model and an example of the type of system where the pattern                                   is used again perhaps with a graphical model you should also include information                                   about  when  the pattern  should   be used  and its  advantages  and disadvantages                                   graphical models of  the architecture associated with the mvc  pattern are shown in                                   figures 63 and 64 these present the architecture from different views—figure 63                                   is a conceptual view and figure 64 shows a possible runtime architecture when this                                   pattern is used for interaction management in a webbased system                                        in a short  section  of  a general  chapter it  is  impossible  to  describe all  of  the                                   generic patterns that can be  used in software  development rather i present some

and independence are fundamental to architectural design                                   because they allow changes to be localized the mvc pattern shown in  figure 62                                   separates elements of a system allowing them to  change independently for exam                                   ple  adding a  new view   or changing  an  existing  view  can  be done  without  any                                   changes to the  underlying  data  in the  model the  layered  architecture  pattern is                                   another way  of  achieving separation  and independence this  pattern  is shown  in                                   figure 65 here the system functionality  is organized into separate layers and each                                   layer  only  relies  on the facilities   and  services offered  by  the  layer immediately                                   beneath it                                       this  layered  approach supports the  incremental development  of  systems as a                                   layer is developed some of the  services provided by that layer  may be made avail                                   able to users the architecture is also changeable and portable so long as its inter                                   face is unchanged a layer can be replaced by another equivalent layer furthermore                                   when layer interfaces change or new facilities are added to a layer only the adjacent                                   layer is affected as layered systems localize machine dependencies in inner layers                                   this makes it easier to provide multiplatform  implementations of  an application sys                                   tem only   the inner  machinedependent  layers  need be reimplemented   to take                                   account of the facilities  of a different operating  system or database                                       figure  66 is  an example of  a layered architecture  with  four  layers the lowest                                   layer includes  system support  software—typically   database and operating  system                                   support  the  next  layer  is  the  application   layer  that  includes   the components                                   concerned with  the application  functionality   and  utility  components  that are used                                   by other  application  components the third  layer  is concerned with  user

advantages               allows replacement of  entire layers so long as the interface is maintained redundant                                       facilities eg authentication can be provided  in each layer to increase the dependability                                       of the system     disadvantages          in practice providing a clean separation between  layers is often difficult and a highlevel                                       layer may have to interact directly with  lowerlevel layers rather than through  the layer                                       immediately  below it performance can be a problem  because of multiple levels of                                       interpretation  of a service request as it is processed at each layer

                 figure  67 is  an example  of  how  this layered  architecture   pattern  can  be applied  to a                                       library   system  called  libsys    which

tools around a repository is an efficient way  to share large amounts of                                   data there is no  need to transmit  data explicitly   from  one component to  another                                   however  components  must   operate around   an agreed  repository   data  model                                   inevitably  this is a compromise between the specific  needs of each tool and it may                                   be difficult  or impossible to integrate new components if  their data models do not fit                                   the agreed schema in practice it may be difficult  to  distribute the repository  over a                                   number of  machines  although  it  is  possible to  distribute  a logically   centralized                                   repository there may be problems with data redundancy and inconsistency                                        in the example shown  in figure  69 the repository  is passive and control  is the                                   responsibility   of  the components  using  the repository   an  alternative  approach

  architecture                                   my  final  example of an architectural  pattern is the pipe  and filter  pattern this is  a                                   model of  the runtime  organization  of  a system where  functional  transformations                                   process their inputs and produce outputs data flows from one to another and is trans

to  output the                                   transformations may execute sequentially or in parallel the data can be processed by                                   each transform item by item or in a single batch                                       the name pipe and filter  comes from the original  unix system where it was pos                                   sible to link  processes using pipes these passed a text stream from one process to                                   another systems that conform to this model can be implemented by combining unix                                   commands using pipes and the control facilities  of  the unix  shell the term filter                                   is used because a transformation filters   out  the data it can  process from its  input                                   data stream                                       variants of  this pattern have been in use since computers were first used for auto

way graphical user interfaces have more complex                                   io  formats and a control  strategy that  is based on events such as mouse clicks or

                 these commonalities   have led  to  the development   of software   architectures                                   that describe  the structure  and  organization  of  particular   types of  software  sys                                   tems  application    architectures   encapsulate  the  principal   characteristics   of  a                                   class of systems for example  in realtime  systems there might  be generic archi                                   tectural  models   of  different   system  types  such as  data collection    systems  or                                   monitoring   systems  although    instances  of  these systems  differ   in  detail  the                                   common  architectural  structure  can be  reused when  developing  new systems  of                                   the same type                                        the application   architecture   may  be  reimplemented   when  developing  new                                   systems but for  many business systems application  reuse is  possible without  re                                   implementation  we see this in the  growth of  enterprise resource planning erp                                   systems from  companies such as sap and oracle  and vertical  software packages                                   cots for  specialized applications in  different areas of business in these systems                                   a generic system is configured and adapted to create a specific business application182

of application architectures on the books website these include descriptions ofbatch dataprocessing systems resource allocation systems and eventbased editing systems                            httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebarchitectureapparch                              for example a  system for  supply chain  management can be adapted for  different                              types of suppliers goods and contractual arrangements                                  as  a software designer you can use models of application architectures in a num                              ber of ways                              1 as    a starting point for the architectural  design process if you are unfamiliar with                                     the type of application  that you are developing you can base your initial  design                                     on a generic application architecture of  course this will  have to be specialized                                     for the specific system being developed but it is a good starting point for design                              2 as    a design checklist if you have developed an architectural design for an appli                                     cation system you  can compare this with  the generic  application  architecture                                     you can check that your design is consistent with the generic architecture                              3 as    a way of organizing the work of the development team the application archi                                     tectures identify   stable structural  features  of  the system architectures  and in                                     many cases it is possible  to develop these in parallel  you can assign work  to                                     group members to implement different  components within  the architecture                              4 as    a means of  assessing components for  reuse if  you  have components  you                                     might be able to reuse you can compare these with the generic structures to see                                     whether there are comparable components in the application architecture                              5 as   a vocabulary for talking  about types of applications if you are discussing a spe                                     cific application or trying  to compare applications of the same types then you can                                     use the concepts identified in the generic architecture to talk about the applications                                  there are many types of application system and in some cases they may seem to                              be very different however  many of these superficially dissimilar  applications  actu                              ally have much in common and thus can be represented by a single abstract applica                              tion architecture  i  illustrate  this

language processing  systems  are systems in                                          which  the users intentions  are expressed in a formal  language such as java                                          the language processing system processes this language into an internal format                                          and then interprets  this internal  representation the bestknown  language pro                                          cessing systems are compilers  which  translate highlevel  language  programs                                          into  machine  code however  language  processing systems  are also used to                                          interpret   command  languages for   databases and information    systems  and

sin                                   gle unit an atomic unit  all  of  the operations in a transaction have to be completed                                   before the database changes are made permanent this ensures that failure of opera                                   tions within  the transaction does not lead to inconsistencies in the database                                       from  a user perspective a transaction is any coherent sequence of operations that                                   satisfies a goal such as find  the times of flights  from  london  to paris if  the user

transaction                                       an  example of a transaction is a customer request to withdraw money from a bank                                   account using an atm this involves getting details of the customers account check                                   ing the balance modifying  the balance by the amount withdrawn and sending com                                   mands to the atm to deliver the cash until all of these steps have been completed the                                   transaction is incomplete and the customer accounts database is not changed                                       transaction  processing  systems are usually  interactive  systems in which  users                                   make asynchronous requests for service  figure 614

                       components it  is  better therefore to  organize the  system around a repository  as                              shown in figure  620                                   this figure illustrates how a language processing system can be part of an integrated                              set of programming support tools in this example the symbol table and syntax tree act                              as a central information  repository tools or tool  fragments communicate through it                              other information that is sometimes embedded in tools such as the grammar definition                              and the definition of the output format for the program have been taken out of the tools                              and put into the repository therefore a syntaxdirected editor can check that the syntax                              of a program is correct as it is being typed and a prettyprinter can create listings of the

architectural     design         65 explain why you normally use several architectural patterns  when designing the architecture                of a large system apart from the information  about patterns that  i have discussed in this                chapter what additional  information  might be useful when designing large systems         66 suggest an architecture for a system such as itunes that is used to sell and distribute music                on the internet  what architectural patterns are the basis for this architecture         67 explain how you would use the reference model of case environments available on the                books web pages to compare the ides offered by different vendors of a programming                language such as java         68 using the generic model of a language processing system presented here design the                architecture  of a system that accepts natural language commands and translates these into                database

design and implementation is the stage in the software engineering processat which an executable software system is developed for some simple systems software design and implementation is software engineering  and all other activities  aremerged with  this process however for  large systems software design  and implementation is only  one of  a set of processes requirements engineering verificationand validation etc involved in  software engineering    software   design   and  implementation    activities   are  invariably    interleavedsoftware design is a creative activity in which you identify  software components andtheir  relationships   based on a  customers  requirements  implementation   is  theprocess of realizing the design as a program sometimes there is  a separate designstage and this design is modeled and documented at other times a design is in  theprogrammers head or roughly  sketched on a whiteboard or sheets of paper designis about how  to solve a  problem so there  is always a design  process however itisnt always necessary or appropriate to describe the design in detail using the umlor other design description language    design  and implementation    are closely  linked  and  you should  normally   takeimplementation issues into  account when developing  a design for example  usingthe uml  to document a design may be the right thing to do if  you are programmingin an objectoriented language such as java or c it is less useful i think if you aredeveloping in a dynamically  typed language like python and makes no sense at all ifyou are implementing your system by configuring  an offtheshelf package as i discussed in chapter  3 agile  methods  usually  work  from  informal   sketches  of thedesign and leave many design decisions to programmers    one  of the most  important  implementation  decisions that  has to be made at anearly stage of a software project is whether or not you should buy or build  the application software in  a wide range of  domains it is now  possible to buy  offtheshelfsystems cots that  can be adapted and tailored  to  the users  requirements forexample if you want to implement a medical records system you can buy a packagethat is already  used in hospitals  it can  be cheaper and faster to use this  approachrather than developing a system in a conventional programming language    when  you develop an application  in  this way the  design process becomes concerned with how  to use the configuration  features of that system to deliver  the system requirements you dont  usually develop  design models of the system such asmodels of  the  system objects  and their  interactions   i  discuss this  cotsbasedapproach to development in chapter 16    i  assume that most  readers of  this book  will   have had experience  of  programdesign and implementation this  is something that you acquire  as you learn to program and master the elements of a programming language like java or python youwill  have probably  learned about good programming  practice  in the  programminglanguages that you have studied as well  as how  to debug programs that  you havedeveloped therefore i dont  cover programming  topics  here instead this chapterhas two aims1 to    show how system modeling  and architectural design covered in chapters 5       and 6 are put into practice in developing an objectoriented  software design195178 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation       fpo structured   design methods    structured design methods propose that software design should be tackled in a methodical way designing a    system involves following the steps of the method and refining the design of a system at increasingly detailed    levels in the 1990s there were a number of competing methods for objectoriented design however the    inventors of the most commonly used methods came together and invented the uml which unified the    notations used in the different methods    rather than focus on methods most discussions now are about processes where design is seen as part of the    overall software development process the rational unified process rup is a good example of a generic    development process                                   httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebstructuredmethods                                   2 to    introduce  important  implementation  issues that  are not usually  covered in                                          programming  books these include software reuse configuration management                                          and open source development                                        as there are a vast number of different development platforms  the chapter is not                                   biased towards any particular programming language or implementation technology                                   therefore i  have presented all examples using the uml   rather than in a program                                   ming language such as java or python                        71 objectoriented                        design         using        the     uml                                   an objectoriented  system is made up of interacting objects that  maintain their own                                   local state and provide operations on that state the representation of the state is pri                                   vate and cannot be accessed directly from outside the object objectoriented design                                   processes involve  designing   object  classes and the  relationships  between  these                                   classes these classes define the objects in the system and their interactions when                                   the design is realized as an executing program  the objects are created dynamically                                   from these class definitions                                        objectoriented systems are easier to change than systems developed using func                                   tional approaches objects include both data and operations to manipulate that data                                   they may therefore be understood and modified as standalone entities changing the                                   implementation of an object or adding services should not affect other system objects                                   because objects are associated with things there is often a clear mapping between real                                   world entities such as hardware components and their controlling objects in the sys                                   tem this improves the understandability and hence the maintainability of the design                                        to develop a  system design from   concept to  detailed  objectoriented  design                                   there are several things that you need to do                                   1 understand    and define the context and the external interactions with the system                                   2 design    the system architecture196                                                             71 \\x02 objectoriented     design using  the uml 179            3 identify      the principal objects in  the system            4 develop     design models            5 specify     interfaces                 like   all creative  activities   design  is not  a clearcut  sequential  process you            develop a design by  getting ideas proposing solutions  and refining  these solutions            as information  becomes available you inevitably  have to backtrack and retry  when            problems arise sometimes you explore options in  detail to see if they work at other            times  you ignore  details until  late in the  process consequently i have deliberately            not illustrated  this process as a simple diagram because that would imply design can            be thought  of as a neat sequence of activities in  fact all  of the above activities  are            interleaved and so influence each other                 i  illustrate these process activities by designing part of the software for the wilder            ness weather station that i  introduced in chapter 1  wilderness weather stations are            deployed in remote areas each weather station records local weather information and            periodically  transfers this to a weather information system using a satellite link711 system        context    and   interactions            the  first stage in any software  design process is to develop an understanding of the            relationships  between the software  that is being  designed and its external environ            ment this  is essential for deciding how to provide  the required system functionality            and how to structure the system to communicate with its environment understanding            of  the context also lets you establish the boundaries of the system                 setting  the system boundaries helps you  decide what features are implemented            in  the system being designed and what  features are in other associated systems in            this  case you need to  decide how functionality   is  distributed  between the control            system  for all  of  the weather  stations and the embedded software  in  the weather            station  itself                 system context  models and interaction models  present complementary views of            the relationships between a system and its environment            1 a     system context  model is  a structural model  that demonstrates the other sys                    tems in the environment of the system being developed            2 an     interaction  model is  a dynamic model  that shows how the system interacts                    with its environment  as it is used                 the context model of a system may be represented using associations associations            simply  show  that there are some relationships  between the entities involved  in  the            association the nature of the relationships is now specified you may therefore docu            ment the environment of the system using a simple block diagram showing the entities            in  the system and their associations this is illustrated in figure 71 which shows that197180 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation                      weather station use cases

                        the link shows that there is one control system but several weather stations one satellite                                   and one general weather information system                                       when  you model the interactions of a system with its environment you should use                                   an abstract approach that does not include too much detail one way to  do this is to                                   use a use case model as i discussed in chapters 4 and 5 each use case represents an                                   interaction with  the system each possible interaction is named in an ellipse and the                                   external entity involved  in the interaction is represented by a stick figure                                       the  use case model for  the weather station is  shown in  figure 72  this shows                                   that the  weather station  interacts  with  the  weather information    system to  report                                   weather data and the status of the weather  station hardware other interactions  are                                   with a control  system that can issue specific weather station control commands as i                                   explained in chapter 5 a stick figure  is used in the uml  to represent other systems                                   as well as human users                                       each of  these use cases should be described in structured natural language this                                   helps designers identify  objects in  the system and gives  them an understanding of                                   what the system is  intended to do  i use a standard format  for this  description that                                   clearly identifies  what information  is exchanged how the interaction is initiated and

this is not essential at this stage                                        the highlevel  architectural  design for  the weather station software  is shown in                                   figure 74 the  weather station is composed of  independent subsystems that com                                   municate  by  broadcasting  messages on a common   infrastructure   shown  as the                                   communication   link  in  figure  74 each subsystem  listens for  messages on that                                   infrastructure    and picks   up  the messages  that  are intended   for  them  this   is                                   another  commonly   used  architectural    style  in  addition   to  those  described   in                                   chapter 6                                        for example  when  the  communications   subsystem  receives  a control  com                                   mand such as shutdown  the command is  picked up  by each of  the other subsys                                   tems which  then shut themselves down in  the correct way the key  benefit of  this                                   architecture  is  that  it  is easy to  support  different   configurations   of  subsystems                                   because the sender of a message does not need to address the message to a partic

to encapsulate all  of these                                          interactions  but in other designs you could  design the system interface as sev                                          eral

summarized data from the weather station instruments to                                          the weather information  system                                   3 the     ground  thermometer  anemometer   and  barometer  object  classes are                                          directly  related  to instruments  in  the system  they reflect  tangible  hardware                                          entities  in the  system and the  operations are concerned  with  controlling   that                                          hardware these objects operate autonomously  to collect  data at the specified                                          frequency  and store  the collected   data locally  this  data  is delivered  to  the                                          weatherdata object on request                                        you use knowledge of the application domain to identify  other objects attributes                                   and services we know that weather stations are often located  in remote places and                                   include various instruments that sometimes go wrong instrument  failures should be                                   reported automatically this implies  that you need attributes and operations to check                                   the correct functioning  of  the instruments there are many remote weather stations                                   so each weather station should have its own identifier                                        at this stage in the design process you should focus on the objects themselves with                                   out thinking  about how  these might be implemented  once you have identified  the                                   objects you then refine  the object  design you look  for common  features and then                                   design the inheritance hierarchy  for  the system for example you  may identify   an                                   instrument superclass which defines the common features of all instruments such as an                                   identifier and get and test operations you may also add new attributes and operations to                                   the superclass such as an attribute that maintains the frequency of data collection202                                                             71 \\x02 objectoriented     design  using the uml 185714 design        models             design or system models as i discussed in chapter 5 show the objects or object classes             in a system they also show the associations and relationships between these entities             these models are the bridge between the system requirements and the implementation             of a system they have to be abstract so that unnecessary detail doesnt hide the rela             tionships  between them and the  system requirements however  they also  have to             include enough detail for programmers to make implementation decisions                  generally you get around this  type of conflict  by  developing models at different             levels of detail where there are close links between requirements engineers design             ers and programmers  then abstract models may  be all  that are required  specific             design decisions may be made as the system is implemented with problems resolved             through informal  discussions when the links  between system specifiers designers             and programmers are indirect eg where a system is being designed in one part of             an organization but implemented elsewhere then more detailed models are likely to             be needed                  an  important  step in  the design  process therefore  is to  decide on the  design             models that you need and the level of  detail required in  these models this depends             on the type of  system that is being developed you design a sequential dataprocess             ing system in  a different way from  an embedded realtime system so you will  need             different  design models  the uml  supports  13 different  types of  models but as i             discussed in chapter 5 you rarely  use all of these minimizing   the number of mod             els that are produced reduces the costs of the design and the time  required to com             plete the design process                  when you use the uml to develop a design you will  normally develop two kinds             of design model             1 structural     models which describe the static structure of the system using object                    classes and their relationships important relationships that may  be documented                    at this  stage are generalization  inheritance  relationships  usesusedby rela                    tionships and composition  relationships             2 dynamic     models which describe the dynamic structure of the system and show                    the  interactions  between the  system objects  interactions  that  may  be docu                    mented include  the sequence of service requests made by objects and the state                    changes that are triggered by these object interactions                  in the  early stages of the design process i  think there  are three models that are             particularly  useful for  adding detail to use case and architectural models             1 subsystem    models which  that show logical  groupings of  objects into coherent                    subsystems these are represented using a form of class diagram with each sub                    system shown as a package with enclosed objects subsystem models are static

sequence of object interactions  these arefigure 77 sequencediagram describing            represented using  a  uml   sequence or  a collaboration    diagram  sequencedata collection

events these  are represented in  the uml   using state diagrams                                          state machine models are dynamic models                                        a subsystem model is a useful static model as it shows how a design is organized into                                   logically related groups of objects i have already shown this type of model in figure 74                                   to show the subsystems in the weather mapping system as well as subsystem models                                   you may also design detailed object models showing all of the objects in the systems                                   and their associations inheritance generalization aggregation etc however there is                                   a danger in doing too much modeling you should not make detailed decisions about the                                   implementation that really should be left to the system programmers                                        sequence models are dynamic models that describe for each mode of interaction                                   the sequence of object interactions that take place when documenting a design you                                   should produce a sequence model for each significant interaction if you have devel                                   oped a use case model then there should be a sequence model for each use case that                                   you have identified                                        figure 77 is  an example of  a sequence model shown as a uml

but can carry on with  other processing2 satcomms    sends a message to weatherstation via a satellite  link  to create a       summary of  the collected  weather data  again  the stick  arrowhead indicates       that satcomms does not suspend itself waiting for a reply3 weatherstation     sends a  message to a  commslink   object  to  summarize  the       weather data in this case the squaredoff style of  arrowhead indicates that the       instance of the weatherstation object class waits for a reply4 commslink    calls the summarize method in the object weatherdata and waits for       a reply5 the    weather data summary is computed and returned to weatherstation via the       commslink  object6 weatherstation     then calls  the satcomms  object  to transmit  the  summarized       data to the weather  information  system through  the satellite  communications       system    the  satcomms and weatherstation objects may  be implemented as concurrentprocesses whose execution can be suspended and resumed the satcomms objectinstance listens for messages from the external system decodes these messages andinitiates weather station operations    sequence diagrams  are  used to  model  the combined   behavior  of  a group  ofobjects but you may also want to summarize the behavior of an object or a subsystemin response to messages and events to do this you can use a state machine modelthat shows how the object instance changes state depending on the messages that itreceives the uml   includes state diagrams  initially   invented by  harel  1987 todescribe state machine models    figure  78 is  a state diagram  for the  weather station  system that shows  how itresponds to requests for various services    you can read this diagram as follows1 if    the system state is shutdown then it can respond to a restart a reconfigure       or a powersave message the unlabeled arrow  with  the black blob  indicates       that the shutdown state is the initial state a restart message causes a transition       to normal operation  both the powersave and reconfigure  messages cause a       transition to  a state in which  the system reconfigures  itself  the state diagram       shows that reconfiguration is only  allowed if  the system has been shut down2 in    the running state the system expects further messages if a shutdown mes       sage is received the object returns to the shutdown state3 if    a reportweather message is received the system moves to the summarizing       state when the summary is complete the system moves to a transmitting state       where the information  is transmitted to the remote system it then returns to the       running state205188 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation

interface design                                   as attributes  are not  defined  in  an interface  specification   however  you  should                                   include operations to

    map onto a single method  in the weatherstation object  in this case the individual                                   operations are encoded in  the command  string associated with  the

ideas put  forward  by  christopher  alexander                                   alexander et al 1977  who suggested that there were certain common patterns of                                   building design that were inherently pleasing and effective the pattern is a description                                   of the problem  and the essence of its solution so that the solution may be

alternative displays          to  be provided when the object state changes all displays are automatically notified and updated  to reflect          the  change     problem  description  in many situations you  have to provide multiple  displays of state information           such as a graphical display and a tabular display not all of these may be known  when the information  is          specified all alternative presentations should  support interaction  and when the state is changed all displays          must  be updated          this pattern may be used in all  situations where more than  one display format for state information  is          required  and where it is not  necessary for the object that maintains the state information  to know  about the          specific display formats used     solution  description   this involves two abstract objects subject and observer and two concrete objects          concretesubject and concreteobject which inherit  the attributes of the related  abstract objects the abstract          objects include  general operations that are applicable in all  situations the state to be displayed is          maintained  in concretesubject which inherits operations from  subject allowing it  to add and remove          observers each observer corresponds to a display and to issue a notification  when the state has changed          the concreteobserver maintains a copy of the state of concretesubject and implements the update          interface of  observer that allows these copies to be kept in step the concreteobserver automatically          displays the state and reflects changes whenever the state is updated          the uml model of  the pattern is shown in  figure 712     consequences the subject only knows the  abstract observer and does not know details of the concrete class          therefore there is minimal  coupling between  these objects because of this lack of knowledge optimizations          that  enhance display performance are impractical changes to the subject may cause a set of linked updates          to  observers to be generated some of which may not be

any design problem                                   you are facing may have an associated pattern that can be applied examples of such                                   problems documented in the

runtime decorator  pattern                                       patterns  support highlevel   concept  reuse when  you try  to  reuse executable                                   components you are inevitably   constrained by  detailed design decisions  that have                                   been made  by  the  implementers   of  these  components  these  range  from   the                                   particular   algorithms  that  have been  used to  implement  the  components  to  the                                   objects and types in  the component  interfaces  when these design decisions  con                                   flict    with   your    particular    requirements    reusing   the   component    is  either                                   impossible  or  introduces  inefficiencies   into  your  system  using  patterns  means                                   that you  reuse the ideas but can  adapt the implementation   to suit  the system that                                   you are developing                                       when  you start designing a system it can be difficult  to know in  advance if you                                   will  need a particular   pattern therefore  using patterns in  a design  process often                                   involves developing  a design experiencing a problem  and then recognizing  that a                                   pattern can be used this is certainly possible if you focus on the 23 generalpurpose210

to  find an appropriate pattern amongst the hun             dreds of different  patterns that have been proposed                  patterns are a great idea but you need experience of software design to use them             effectively   you  have  to  recognize  situations   where  a  pattern  can be  applied             inexperienced programmers  even if they  have read the pattern books will   always             find  it hard to decide whether they  can reuse a pattern or need to develop a special             purpose solution 73 implementation                         issues             software engineering includes all  of the activities involved  in software development             from  the initial   requirements  of the  system through  to maintenance and  manage             ment of  the deployed system a  critical  stage of  this process is of  course system             implementation    where   you   create   an  executable   version   of   the   software             implementation may involve developing programs in high or lowlevel programming             languages or tailoring and adapting generic offtheshelf systems to meet the specific             requirements of an organization                  i assume that most readers of this book will   understand programming principles             and will  have some programming  experience as this chapter is  intended to offer  a             languageindependent approach i havent  focused on issues of good programming             practice  as this has to  use languagespecific  examples instead i  introduce  some             aspects of implementation   that are particularly   important  to software  engineering             that are often not covered in programming  texts these are             1 reuse most    modern software is  constructed by reusing existing components or                    systems when you  are developing software you  should make as much use as                    possible of existing  code             2 configuration      management during   the development  process many different                    versions  of each software  component  are created if  you  dont  keep track  of                    these versions in a configuration  management system you are liable to include                    the wrong versions of  these components in your system             3 hosttarget     development production  software does not  usually execute on the                    same computer as the software development environment rather you  develop                    it  on one computer the host system and execute it on a separate computer the                    target system the host and target systems are sometimes of the same type but                    often they are completely  different731 reuse             from  the 1960s to the  1990s most new software  was developed from  scratch by             writing  all code in a highlevel  programming language the only significant  reuse or211194 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation                                   software was the reuse of functions and objects in  programming  language libraries                                   however costs and schedule pressure meant that this approach became increasingly                                   unviable especially  for  commercial  and internetbased systems consequently an                                   approach to development based around the reuse of existing software emerged and is                                   now generally  used for  business systems scientific software  and increasingly  in                                   embedded systems engineering                                       software  reuse is possible at a number of different levels                                   1 the    abstraction  level at  this level you  dont reuse software directly  but rather                                          use knowledge of successful abstractions in the design of your software design                                          patterns and architectural patterns covered in chapter 6 are ways of represent                                          ing abstract knowledge for  reuse                                   2 the    object  level at  this  level you  directly  reuse objects from  a library  rather                                          than writing  the code yourself to implement this type of reuse you have to find                                          appropriate libraries and discover if  the objects and methods offer the function                                          ality  that you need for example if you need to process mail messages in a java                                          program you may use objects and methods from a javamail library                                   3 the    component level components are collections  of  objects and object classes                                          that operate together to provide related functions and services you often have to                                          adapt and extend the component by adding some code of your own an example                                          of componentlevel  reuse is where you build your  user interface using a frame                                          work  this is a set of general object classes that implement event handling dis                                          play  management etc  you add connections  to  the data to  be displayed  and                                          write  code to define specific display details such as screen layout and colors                                   4 the    system level at this level you reuse entire application systems this usually                                          involves  some kind  of  configuration   of these systems  this may  be done by                                          adding and modifying   code if  you  are reusing a software  product line  or  by                                          using the systems  own configuration  interface  most  commercial systems are                                          now built  in  this way where  generic cots commercial  offtheshelf  systems                                          are adapted and reused sometimes this approach may involve  reusing several                                          different  systems and integrating these to create a new system                                       by  reusing  existing software  you can develop new  systems more quickly  with                                   fewer development risks and also lower costs as the reused software has been tested                                   in other applications  it  should be more reliable  than new software however there                                   are costs associated with reuse                                   1 the     costs of  the time  spent  in  looking   for  software  to  reuse and assessing                                          whether or not  it meets your needs you may have to test the software to  make                                          sure that it will  work  in your  environment especially if  this is different  from its                                          development environment                                   2 where    applicable  the costs of buying  the reusable software for large offthe                                          shelf systems these costs can be very high212                                                                                       73 \\x02 implementation     issues 195             3 the     costs of adapting and configuring the reusable software components or sys                     tems to reflect the requirements of the system that you are developing             4 the     costs of integrating  reusable software elements with each other if  you are                     using software  from  different   sources and with  the  new code that  you have                     developed integrating reusable software  from different  providers  can be diffi                     cult  and expensive because the providers  may make  conflicting   assumptions                     about how their respective software will  be reused                  how  to reuse existing knowledge and software should be the first thing you should             think  about when  starting a software development project  you should consider the             possibilities  of reuse before designing the software in detail as you may wish to adapt             your  design to reuse existing software assets as i discussed in chapter 2 in a reuse             oriented  development process you  search for reusable elements then modify  your             requirements and design to make best use of these                  for  a large number  of  application  systems software  engineering really  means             software  reuse i therefore devote several chapters in the software technologies sec             tion  of the book to this  topic chapters 16 17 and 19732 configuration            management             in  software  development change happens all  the time  so change management is             absolutely  essential when  a team of people  are developing software  you have to             make sure that team members dont interfere  with each others work  that is if  two             people are working on a component their changes have to be coordinated otherwise             one programmer may make changes and overwrite the others work you also have to             ensure that everyone can access the most uptodate versions of software components             otherwise  developers may redo work  that has already been done when  something             goes wrong with  a new version of a system you have to be able to go back to a work             ing  version of the system or component                  configuration  management is the name given to the general process of managing             a changing software system the aim of  configuration  management is to support the             system integration process so that all developers can access the project code and doc             uments in a controlled  way find out what changes have been made and compile and             link  components to create a system there are therefore three fundamental configu             ration  management activities             1 version     management where support is  provided to  keep track of  the different                     versions of software  components version management systems include facili                     ties to coordinate  development by  several programmers they stop one devel                     oper overwriting  code that has been submitted to the system by someone else             2 system     integration  where support is  provided  to help developers define  what                     versions  of  components  are used  to create  each version  of   a system  this                     description is then used to build  a system automatically by  compiling  and link                     ing the required components213196 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation                                   3 problem

              these tools may be designed to work together in a comprehensive change management                                   system such as clearcase bellagio and milligan 2005 in integrated

user interface style and are integrated through                                   a common code repository                                       alternatively   separate tools installed in an integrated development environment                                   may be used version management may be supported using a version  management                                   system such as subversion pilato et al 2008 which can support multisite  multi                                   team development system integration support may be built into the language or rely                                   on a separate toolset such as the gnu build  system this includes  what is perhaps                                   the bestknown integration tool  unix make bug tracking  or issue tracking systems                                   such as bugzilla   are used  to report  bugs  and other  issues and to  keep track  of                                   whether or not these have been fixed                                       because of its  importance in professional software  engineering i discuss change                                   and configuration management in

                                 one computer the host but runs on a separate machine the target more generally                                   we can talk about a development platform  and an execution platform a  platform  is                                   more than just hardware it includes the installed operating system plus other support                                   ing software such as a database management system or for development platforms                                   an interactive development environment                                       sometimes the development and execution platforms are the same making it possi                                   ble to develop the software and test it on the same machine more commonly however

developer can have their own execution platform with no need to download the                                   software to the target hardware however simulators are expensive to develop and so                                   are only usually available for the most popular hardware architectures                                       if  the  target system has installed middleware  or other software  that you need to                                   use then you need to be able to test the system using that software it may be imprac                                   tical to  install

        tems development in java or embedded systems engineering using c                              as part of  the development process you need to  make decisions about how the                         developed software will  be deployed on  the target platform this  is straightforward215198 chapter    7 \\x02 design    and implementation                                   for embedded systems where the target is usually  a single computer however  for                                   distributed systems you need to decide on the specific platforms  where the compo                                   nents will  be deployed issues that you have to consider in making this decision are                                   1 the    hardware  and  software requirements  of  a component if   a component  is                                          designed for a specific  hardware architecture or relies  on some other software                                          system it must obviously  be deployed on a platform  that provides the required                                          hardware and software support                                   2 the    availability    requirements   of the  system highavailability     systems may                                          require components to be deployed on more than one platform this means that                                          in the event of platform  failure an alternative implementation  of the component                                          is available                                   3 component    communications if   there is a high  level of  communications  traffic                                          between components it usually  makes sense to deploy them on the same plat                                          form  or  on  platforms   that  are physically    close to  one  other  this  reduces                                          communications  latency the delay between the time  a message is sent by one                                          component and received by another                                   you can document your decisions on hardware and software deployment using uml                                   deployment diagrams which  show how software components are distributed across                                   hardware platforms                                       if  you  are developing  an embedded system you may have to  take into  account                                   target characteristics such as its physical size power capabilities the need for real                                   time responses to sensor events the physical characteristics of actuators and its real                                   time

an approach  to software  development  in  which  the                                   source code of a software system is published  and volunteers are invited to  partici                                   pate in the development process raymond 2001 its roots are in the free software                                   foundation  httpwwwfsforg   which   advocates that source code should  not be                                   proprietary but rather should always be available for users to examine and modify as                                   they wish  there was an assumption that  the code would  be controlled  and devel                                   oped by a small core group rather than users of the code                                       open  source software extended this idea by using  the internet to recruit  a much                                   larger population of  volunteer developers many  of them are also users of the code                                   in principle   at least any contributor  to  an open source project  may report  and fix                                   bugs and propose new features and functionality   however in  practice successful                                   open source systems still rely on a core group of developers who control  changes to                                   the software216

system and increasingly as a desktop environmentother important   open source products  are java the  apache web  server and  themysql database management system major players in the computer industry suchas ibm and sun support the open source movement and base their software on opensource products there are thousands of  other lesser known  open source systemsand components that may also be used    it  is usually  fairly   cheap or free to  acquire open source software  you can normally download  open source software without  charge however if  you want  documentation and support then you may have to pay for this but costs are usually fairlylow the other key benefit of  using open source products is that mature open sourcesystems are usually very reliable the reason for this is  that they have a large population of  users who are willing   to fix  problems  themselves rather than report theseproblems to the developer and wait for a new release of the system bugs are discovered and repaired more quickly than is usually possible with  proprietary software    for  a company  involved  in  software  development  there are  two open  sourceissues that have to be considered1 should   the product that is being developed make use of open source components2 should    an open source approach be used for the softwares development    the answers to these questions depend on the type of software that is being developed and the background and experience of the development team    if  you are developing a software product for sale then time to market and reducedcosts are critical if  you are developing in  a domain in  which there are highqualityopen source systems available you can save time and money by using these systemshowever if  you are developing software to  a specific set of organizational  requirements then using open source components may not be an option you may  have tointegrate your  software with  existing  systems that are incompatible  with  availableopen source systems even then however it could be quicker and cheaper to modifythe open source system rather than redevelop the functionality that you need    more  and more product companies are using an open source approach to development their business model is not reliant on selling  a software product but rather onselling support for that product they believe that involving  the open source community will  allow  software to be developed more cheaply more quickly and will createa community of users for the software again however this is really  only applicablefor general software products rather than specific organizational applications    many  companies believe that adopting an open source approach will reveal confidential business knowledge  to their  competitors  and so are reluctant  to adopt  thisdevelopment model however if you  are working in  a small company and you opensource your software this may  reassure customers that they will  be able to supportthe software if your company goes out of business    publishing  the source code of a system does not mean that people from the widercommunity will   necessarily help with its development most  successful

opensource development is  that source code                                   should be freely available  this does not mean that anyone can do as they wish with                                   that

source component is used to develop                                   a new system then  that system should  also be open source others  are willing   to                                   allow their  code to be used without  this restriction  the developed systems may be                                   proprietary and sold as closed source systems                                        most open source licenses are derived from one of three general models                                   1 the    gnu general public  license gpl this is a socalled reciprocal  license                                          that simplistically   means that if you  use open source software that is licensed                                          under the gpl license then you must make that software open source                                   2 the    gnu  lesser general public license lgpl  this  is a variant of  the gpl                                          license where you can write  components that link  to open source code without                                          having to  publish the source of  these components however if you  change the                                          licensed component then you must publish this as open source                                   3 the    berkley   standard distribution    bsd  license  this  is a nonreciprocal                                          license which means you are not obliged to republish any changes or modifica                                          tions made to open source code you can include the code in proprietary systems                                          that are sold  if  you use open source components you  must acknowledge  the                                          original  creator of the code                                        licensing issues are important because if you use opensource software as part of                                   a software product then you may be obliged by the terms of the license to make your                                   own product  open source if you  are trying  to sell  your software  you may wish  to                                   keep it  secret this  means that you  may wish  to  avoid  using gpllicensed  open                                   source software in its development                                        if you are building  software that runs on an open source platform such as linux                                   then licenses are not a problem however as soon as you start including open source                                   components in  your software  you  need to set up processes and databases to keep                                   track of whats been used and their license conditions bayersdorfer 2007 suggests                                   that companies managing projects that use open source should                                   1 establish    a system for  maintaining information   about open source components                                          that are downloaded and used you have to keep a copy of  the license for each218                                                                                                                    chapter 7 \\x02 key   points 201                                        component that  was valid at  the time  the component was used licenses may                                        change so you need to know the conditions that you have agreed to                                 2 be    aware of the different  types of licenses and understand how a component is                                        licensed before it is used you may decide to use a component in one system but                                        not in another because you plan to use these systems in different ways                                 3 be    aware of evolution  pathways for components you need to know a bit  about                                        the open source project  where  components are developed  to understand how                                        they might change in future                                 4 educate    people about open source its not enough to  have procedures in place                                        to ensure compliance with license conditions you also need to educate develop                                        ers about open source and open source licensing                                 5 have    auditing  systems in  place  developers under  tight  deadlines might  be                                        tempted to break the terms of a license if possible you should have software in                                        place to detect and stop this                                 6 participate    in the open source community  if you  rely on open source products                                        you should participate in  the community and help support their  development                                     the business model of software  is changing it is becoming increasingly  difficult                                 to build a business by selling  specialized software systems many companies prefer                                 to make their software open source and then sell support and consultancy to software                                 users this trend is likely  to accelerate with increasing use of open source software                                 and with more and more software available in this  formkey

\\x02 understand the stages of testing from testing during development              to acceptance testing by system customers           \\x02 have been introduced to techniques that help you choose test              cases that are geared to discovering program defects           \\x02 understand testfirst development where you design tests before              writing code and run these tests automatically           \\x02 know the important differences between component system              and release testing and be aware of user testing processes and              techniques

you execute                                   a program using artificial  data you check the results of the test run for errors anom                                   alies or information  about the programs nonfunctional  attributes                                       the  testing process has two distinct goals                                   1 to    demonstrate to  the developer and the  customer that the software  meets its                                          requirements for custom software this  means that there should be at least one                                          test for  every requirement in  the requirements document for generic software                                          products it  means that there should be tests for all of  the system features plus                                          combinations of  these features that will be incorporated in the product release                                   2 to    discover situations in  which  the behavior of the software  is incorrect unde                                          sirable  or does not  conform  to its  specification  these are a consequence of                                          software defects defect  testing is concerned with  rooting  out undesirable sys                                          tem behavior such as system crashes unwanted interactions with other systems                                          incorrect computations and data corruption                                       the  first goal leads to validation  testing where you expect the system to perform                                   correctly  using a given set of  test cases that reflect the systems expected use the                                   second goal  leads to defect  testing  where  the test cases are designed  to expose                                   defects the test  cases in defect testing  can be deliberately  obscure and  need not                                   reflect  how the system is  normally  used of  course there is  no definite  boundary                                   between these two  approaches to testing during   validation  testing  you will   find                                   defects in the system during defect testing some of the tests will  show that the pro                                   gram meets its requirements                                       the  diagram shown  in figure  81 may  help to  explain  the differences between                                   validation  testing  and defect testing  think  of  the system  being tested as a black                                   box the  system accepts inputs from  some input  set i and generates outputs in  an                                   output set o some of the outputs will  be erroneous these are the outputs in set oe                                   that are generated by the system in  response to inputs in  the set ie the priority  in                                   defect testing is to find  those inputs in the set ie because these reveal problems with                                   the system validation testing involves testing  with correct inputs  that are outside ie                                   these stimulate the system to generate the expected correct outputs                                       testing  cannot  demonstrate that  the software  is  free  of defects  or that  it  will                                   behave as specified in every circumstance it  is always possible that  a test that you                                   have overlooked   could  discover   further  problems   with  the  system  as  edsger                                   dijkstra an early contributor  to the development of

                      verification   and validation  processes are concerned with checking that software                                   being developed meets its specification and delivers the functionality expected by the                                   people paying for the software these checking processes start as soon as requirements                                   become available and continue through all stages of the development process                                       the aim of  verification is to check that the software meets its stated functional and                                   nonfunctional requirements validation however is a more general process the aim                                   of validation  is to ensure that the software meets the customers expectations it goes                                   beyond simply checking conformance with the specification to demonstrating that the                                   software does what the customer expects it to do validation  is essential because as                                    i discussed in chapter 4  requirements specifications do  not always reflect  the real

need to devote as much time to testing the soft                                          ware however as software matures users expect it to become more reliable so                                          more thorough testing of  later versions may be required                                   3 marketing     environment when  a system is  marketed the sellers  of the system

delivering  that  system in a                                          competitive environment  a software company may decide to release a program                                          before it  has been fully  tested and debugged because they want to be the  first                                          into the market if  a software product is very cheap users may be willing to tol

            the stages in the process where the techniques may be used                                       inspections  mostly focus on  the source code of a system but any readable repre                                   sentation  of  the  software  such  as its  requirements  or  a  design  model  can  be                                   inspected when you inspect a system you use knowledge of the system its applica                                   tion domain and the programming  or modeling language to discover errors                                       there are three advantages of software inspection over testing                                   1 during     testing  errors  can mask  hide  other  errors when  an error  leads to                                          unexpected outputs you can never be sure if  later output  anomalies are due to                                          a new  error or  are side  effects of  the original   error  because inspection  is a                                          static  process  you  dont  have  to  be concerned  with   interactions   between                                          errors consequently a single inspection  session can discover many errors in a                                          system226

testing process taking into account the people and the time available usually a test plan will becreated which defines what is to be tested the predicted testing schedule and how tests will be recorded forcritical systems the test plan may also include details of the tests to be run on the software                            httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebtestingplanninghtml                              2 incomplete     versions of  a system can be inspected without  additional   costs if                                     a program is  incomplete  then you need to  develop specialized  test harnesses                                     to test the parts that are available  this obviously   adds to the system develop                                     ment costs                              3 as     well  as searching  for  program   defects an  inspection  can  also consider                                     broader quality   attributes  of  a program  such as compliance  with  standards                                     portability  and  maintainability  you  can look  for inefficiencies   inappropriate                                     algorithms and poor programming  style that could make the system difficult   to                                     maintain and update                                  program  inspections   are an old  idea and  there have been several  studies and                              experiments that  have demonstrated that inspections  are more effective  for  defect                              discovery than  program testing  fagan 1986 reported that  more than 60  of the                              errors in  a program  can  be detected using  informal   program  inspections  in  the                              cleanroom process prowell et al 1999 it is claimed that more than 90 of defects                              can be discovered in program inspections                                  however  inspections  cannot replace software testing  inspections are not good                              for discovering  defects  that arise because of unexpected interactions  between dif

it  can                              be difficult   and expensive to put  together a separate inspection  team as all poten                              tial  members of the  team may also be software

source text  of a program is automatically   analyzed to discover                              anomalies  is  explained   in chapter   15 in  this  chapter  i  focus  on  testing  and

                             ble as people who understand what the system is supposed to do must be involved to                              specify  the expected test results  however  test execution  can be automated the                              expected results are automatically compared with the predicted results so there is no                              need for a person to look for errors and anomalies in the test run227210 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing                                   test                                 test                                 test

                                       in the testing process                                   2 release    testing where a separate testing team tests a complete  version of  the                                          system before it is  released to users the aim of release testing is to check that                                          the system meets the requirements of system stakeholders                                   3 user    testing where users or potential  users of a system test the system in their                                          own environment  for

               acceptance testing is one type of user testing where the customer formally tests                                          a system to decide if it should be accepted from the system supplier or if further                                          development is required                                       in  practice  the testing process usually  involves  a mixture  of  manual and auto                                   mated testing in manual  testing a tester runs the program with  some test data and                                   compares the results to their expectations they note and report discrepancies to the                                   program developers in automated testing the tests are encoded in a program that is                                   run each time  the system under development  is to be tested this  is usually  faster                                   than manual testing especially when it  involves regression testing—rerunning  pre                                   vious tests to check that changes to the program have not introduced new bugs                                       the  use of automated testing has increased considerably over the past few years                                   however testing  can never be completely  automated  as automated tests can only                                   check that a program does what it is supposed to do it is practically impossible to use                                   automated testing to test systems that depend on how things  look eg  a graphical                                   user interface or to test that a program does not have unwanted side effects                       81 development                     testing

that i discussed                                   in chapter 7 the interface of this object is shown in figure 84 it has a single attribute                                   which is its identifier this is a constant that is set when the weather station is installed                                   you therefore only need a test that checks if it has been properly set up you need to                                   define test cases for all of the methods associated with the object such as reportweather                                   reportstatus etc ideally you should test methods in isolation but in some cases some                                   test sequences are necessary for example to test the method that  shuts down the                                   weather station instruments shutdown you need to have executed the restart method                                       generalization  or inheritance  makes object class testing more  complicated you                                   cant simply  test an operation in the class where it is defined and assume that it will                                   work  as expected in the subclasses that inherit the operation  the operation that  is                                   inherited may  make assumptions about other operations and  attributes these may                                   not be valid in  some subclasses that inherit the operation you therefore have to test                                   the inherited operation in all  of the contexts where it is used                                       to  test the states of the weather  station you use a state model  such as the one                                   shown in  figure  78 in  the previous  chapter  using  this model  you  can identify                                   sequences of state transitions that have to  be tested and define event sequences to                                   force these transitions  in principle   you should  test every possible state transition                                   sequence although   in  practice  this   may  be too  expensive   examples  of  state                                   sequences that should be tested in the weather station include                                       shutdown → running → shutdown                                       configuring → running

you should automate unit  testing in  automated unit testing                                   you make use of a test automation framework  such as junit to write  and run your                                   program tests unit  testing frameworks provide  generic test classes that you extend                                   to create specific test cases they can then run all  of the tests that you  have imple                                   mented and report often through some gui on the success or failure of the tests an                                   entire test suite can often be run in  a few seconds so it is possible to execute all the                                   tests every time you make a change to the program                                       an  automated test has three parts                                   1 a     setup part  where you  initialize   the system  with  the test  case namely the                                          inputs and expected outputs230                                                                                          81 \\x02 development     testing 213             2 a     call part where you  call the object or method to be tested             3 an     assertion  part where you  compare the result  of  the call  with  the expected                     result if  the assertion  evaluates to true the test  has been successful if  false                     then it has failed                  sometimes the object that you  are testing has dependencies on other objects that             may  not have been written or which  slow down  the testing process if they are used             for  example if  your object  calls a database this may involve a slow  setup process             before  it  can be used in these cases you may  decide to use mock  objects mock             objects  are objects with  the same interface  as the external objects  being used that             simulate  its functionality  therefore a mock  object simulating  a database may have             only  a few data items that are organized in an array they can therefore be accessed             quickly  without  the overheads of calling  a database and accessing disks similarly             mock  objects can be used to simulate abnormal operation or rare events for exam             ple  if  your  system is  intended to  take action  at certain  times  of  day your  mock             object  can simply return those times irrespective of the actual clock  time812 choosing         unit    test   cases             testing is expensive and time consuming so it is important that you choose effective             unit  test cases effectiveness in this case means two things             1 the    test cases should show that when used as expected the component that you                     are testing does what it is supposed to do             2 if     there are defects in the component these should be revealed by test cases                  you should therefore write  two kinds of  test case the first of these should reflect             normal  operation  of  a program  and should  show  that the  component works  for             example  if  you are testing  a component  that creates and initializes  a  new patient             record  then your test case should show that the record exists in a database and that             its  fields have been set as specified the other kind  of test case should be based on             testing  experience of where common problems  arise it should use abnormal inputs             to check that these are properly processed and do not crash the component                  i  discuss two possible strategies here that can be effective in helping you  choose             test cases these are             1 partition     testing where you identify  groups of inputs that have common charac                     teristics and should be processed in the same way you should choose tests from                     within  each of these groups             2 guidelinebased     testing where you  use testing guidelines to choose test cases                     these guidelines reflect previous experience of the kinds of errors that program                     mers often make when developing components231214 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing

                        the input data and output results of a program  often fall  into a number of differ                                   ent classes with  common  characteristics   examples of  these classes are positive                                   numbers negative numbers and  menu selections programs normally   behave in a                                   comparable way for all  members of a class that is if you test a program that does a                                   computation and requires two positive numbers then you would  expect the program                                   to behave in the same way for all positive numbers                                        because of this equivalent  behavior these classes are sometimes called equiva                                   lence partitions  or  domains  bezier 1990  one systematic  approach to  test case                                   design is based on identifying all  input and output partitions  for a system or compo                                   nent test cases are designed so that the inputs or outputs lie within these partitions                                   partition testing can be used to design test cases for both systems and components                                        in figure 85 the large shaded ellipse on the left represents the set of all possible                                   inputs to  the program that  is being tested the smaller  unshaded ellipses represent                                   equivalence partitions a program  being tested should process all of the members of                                   an input  equivalence partitions  in the same way  output equivalence partitions  are                                   partitions  within  which  all  of  the outputs have something  in common  sometimes                                   there is a 11  mapping between  input and output  equivalence partitions  however                                   this is not always the case you may need to define a separate input equivalence par                                   tition  where the only common  characteristic of the inputs  is that they generate out                                   puts within  the same output partition  the shaded area in the left  ellipse represents                                   inputs that are invalid the shaded area in the right ellipse represents exceptions that                                   may occur ie responses to invalid inputs                                        once you have identified  a set of partitions  you  choose test cases from each of                                   these partitions a  good rule of  thumb for  test case selection is to choose test cases                                   on the boundaries of the partitions  plus cases close to the midpoint of the partition                                   the reason for this is that designers and programmers tend to consider typical values                                   of inputs when  developing a system you test these by choosing the midpoint of the                                   partition  boundary values are often atypical eg zero may behave differently from                                   other nonnegative numbers so are sometimes overlooked  by developers program                                   failures often occur when  processing these atypical values232                                                                                                               81 \\x02 development

                      and from  experience where you predict  the classes of input value  that are likely  to                                   detect errors  for  example  say a program  specification   states that  the program                                   accepts 4 to 8 inputs which  are fivedigit  integers greater than 10000 you use this                                   information  to identify  the input  partitions and possible test input  values these are                                   shown in figure 86                                        when you use the specification of a system to identify equivalence partitions this                                   is called blackbox  testing here you dont  need any knowledge of how the system                                   works however  it may  be helpful  to supplement  the blackbox  tests with  white                                   box testing  where you look  at the code of the program to find  other possible tests                                   for example your code may include  exceptions to handle incorrect inputs  you can                                   use this knowledge  to  identify  exception   partitions—different    ranges where the                                   same exception handling should be applied                                        equivalence  partitioning   is  an effective   approach to  testing  because it  helps                                   account for errors that programmers often make when processing inputs at the edges

effective for dis                                   covering errors for example when you are testing programs with sequences arrays                                   or lists guidelines that could  help reveal defects include                                   1 test    software with  sequences that have only a single value programmers natu                                          rally  think of sequences as made up of several values and sometimes they embed                                          this  assumption in  their  programs  consequently if  presented with   a single                                          value sequence a program may not work properly                                   2 use    different  sequences of different  sizes in different  tests this decreases the                                          chances that a program with  defects will  accidentally  produce a correct output                                          because of some accidental characteristics of the input                                   3 derive     tests so that  the  first  middle  and  last elements  of  the sequence are

conditional statements are tested for both true and false cases in an objectoriented     development process path testing may be used when testing the methods associated with objects

                in test case design some of the most general guidelines that he suggests are                                   \\x02 choose inputs  that force the system to generate all error messages                                   \\x02 design  inputs that cause input buffers to overflow                                   \\x02 repeat the same input or series of inputs numerous times                                   \\x02 force  invalid outputs to be generated                                   \\x02 force  computation results to be too large or too small                                       as  you gain experience with  testing you can develop your own guidelines  about                                   how to choose effective test cases i give more examples of testing guidelines in  the

that are made up of  several                                   interacting objects  for example in the  weather station system the reconfiguration                                   component includes objects  that deal with  each aspect of the  reconfiguration  you                                   access the functionality  of  these objects through  the defined component  interface                                   testing composite components should therefore  focus on showing  that the compo                                   nent interface behaves according to its specification  you can assume that unit tests                                   on the individual  objects within  the component have been completed                                       figure  87 illustrates the idea of component interface testing assume that compo                                   nents a b  and c have been integrated to create a larger component or subsystem                                   the test cases are not applied to the individual components but rather to the interface                                   of the composite component created by combining these components interface errors                                   in the composite component may  not be detectable by testing the individual  objects                                   because these errors result from interactions between the objects in the component                                       there  are different  types of interface  between program components and conse                                   quently

       shared between components data is placed  in the memory  by  one subsystem                                          and retrieved  from there  by other  subsystems this type  of interface  is often                                          used in  embedded  systems where  sensors create data  that is  retrieved  and                                          processed by other system components                                   3 procedural     interfaces these  are interfaces in  which  one component encapsu                                          lates a set of  procedures that can be called  by other components objects  and                                          reusable components have this form of interface                                   4 message    passing  interfaces these   are  interfaces  in  which   one component                                          requests a service from another component by passing a message to it a return

systems                                        interface errors are one of the most  common forms  of error in  complex systems                                   lutz 1993  these errors fall into three classes                                   \\x02 interface  misuse a calling  component calls some other component and makes an                                        error in the use of its interface this type of error is common with parameter inter                                        faces where parameters may  be of  the wrong  type  or be passed in  the wrong                                        order or the wrong number of parameters may be passed                                   \\x02 interface   misunderstanding a  calling  component misunderstands the  specifica                                        tion of  the interface  of  the called component  and makes assumptions about  its                                        behavior the called component does not behave as expected which then causes                                        unexpected behavior  in  the calling   component  for example  a binary  search                                        method may be  called with  a parameter that  is an unordered  array the search                                        would then fail                                   \\x02 timing   errors these occur  in realtime  systems that  use a shared memory or  a                                        messagepassing interface the producer of data and the consumer of  data may235218 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing                                        operate at different speeds unless particular care is taken in the interface design                                        the consumer can  access outofdate  information   because the producer of  the                                        information  has not updated the shared interface information                                        testing for  interface defects is difficult   because some interface faults  may only                                   manifest themselves under  unusual conditions  for example  say an object imple                                   ments a queue as a fixedlength data structure a calling object may assume that the                                   queue is implemented as an infinite data structure and may not check for queue over                                   flow  when an item is entered this condition  can only be detected during testing by                                   designing test cases that force the queue to overflow and cause that overflow to cor                                   rupt the object behavior in some detectable way                                        a further  problem  may arise because of interactions  between faults in  different                                   modules or objects faults in one object may only be detected when some other object                                   behaves in an unexpected way for  example an object  may call  another object  to                                   receive some service and assume that the response is correct if the called service is                                   faulty in some way the returned value may be valid but incorrect this is not immedi                                   ately detected but only becomes obvious when some later computation goes wrong                                        some general guidelines for interface testing are                                   1 examine    the code to be tested and explicitly list  each call to an external compo                                          nent design a set of tests in which  the values of the parameters to the external                                          components are at the extreme ends of  their ranges these extreme values are                                          most likely  to reveal interface inconsistencies                                   2 where    pointers are passed across an interface always test the interface with null                                          pointer parameters                                   3 where    a component  is called  through a procedural  interface design  tests that                                          deliberately  cause the component to fail differing   failure  assumptions are one                                          of the most common specification  misunderstandings                                   4 use    stress testing  in  message passing systems  this  means that you  should                                          design tests that generate many more messages than are likely to occur in prac                                          tice this is an effective  way of revealing timing  problems                                   5 where    several components  interact through  shared memory  design tests that                                          vary the order in  which these components are activated these tests may reveal                                          implicit   assumptions  made by the  programmer  about the  order in  which  the                                          shared data is produced and consumed                                        inspections and reviews  can sometimes be more  cost effective  than testing  for                                   discovering  interface errors  inspections can concentrate  on component interfaces                                   and questions  about the assumed interface  behavior  asked during  the  inspection                                   process a strongly  typed language such as java allows many interface errors to be                                   trapped by the compiler  static analyzers see chapter 15  can detect a wide range                                   of interface errors236

the integrated system that you have createdyou should always use an incremental approach to integration and testing ie you should integrate a componenttest the system integrate another component test again and so on this means that if problems occur it is probablydue to interactions with the most recently integrated componentincremental integration and testing is fundamental to agile methods such as xp where regression tests see section82 are run every time a new increment is integrated                           httpwwwsoftwareengineering9comwebtestingintegrationhtml                814 system         testing                              system testing during development involves  integrating components to create a ver                              sion of  the system and then testing the integrated system system testing checks that                              components are compatible interact correctly  and transfer the right data at the right                              time  across their interfaces it obviously  overlaps with  component testing  but there                              are two important  differences                              1 during      system testing reusable components that  have been separately devel                                     oped and offtheshelf systems may be integrated with newly developed compo                                     nents the complete system is then tested                              2 components    developed by different  team members or groups may be integrated                                     at this  stage system testing is a collective rather than an individual  process in                                     some companies  system testing may  involve  a separate testing team with  no                                     involvement  from designers and programmers                                   when you  integrate components to create a system you get emergent behavior                              this  means that some elements of system functionality  only become obvious when                              you  put the components  together this may  be planned emergent behavior which                              has to be tested for example you may integrate an authentication component with a                              component  that updates information  you then  have a system feature that restricts                              information    updating  to  authorized   users  sometimes  however  the  emergent                              behavior  is unplanned and unwanted you have to develop tests that check  that the                              system is only doing  what it is supposed to do                                   therefore  system testing  should focus  on testing  the interactions  between  the                              components and objects that make up a system you may also test reusable compo                              nents or systems to check that they work  as expected when they are integrated with                              new components this interaction testing should discover those component bugs that                              are only  revealed when  a component is  used by other  components in  the system                              interaction  testing also helps find misunderstandings made by component develop                              ers about other components in the system                                   because of  its  focus   on interactions   use case–based testing   is an  effective                              approach to system testing typically each use case is implemented by several com                              ponents or  objects in  the system testing the  use case forces these

               computer the  use case for this  is described in  figure  73 see previous chapter                                   figure 88 which  is  a copy of figure  77 shows the sequence of operations in  the                                   weather station when it responds to a request to collect data for the mapping system                                   you can use this diagram to identify operations that will  be tested and to help design                                   the test cases to execute the tests therefore issuing a request for a report will result

inputs are required and what outputs are created                                   1 an     input of  a request for a report  should have an associated acknowledgment                                          a report  should  ultimately   be returned from  the  request during  testing  you                                          should  create summarized  data that  can  be used to  check that  the  report  is                                          correctly organized                                   2 an     input request for  a report to weatherstation results in  a summarized report                                          being  generated you  can  test this  in  isolation   by  creating  raw  data corre                                          sponding to the summary that  you have prepared for the test of satcomms and                                          checking that the weatherstation object  correctly produces this  summary this                                          raw data is also used to test the weatherdata object238                                                                                  82 \\x02 testdriven    development 221                 of course i have simplified the sequence diagram in figure 88 so that it does not            show exceptions a complete use casescenario test must also take these into account            and ensure that objects correctly handle exceptions                 for most systems it is difficult  to know  how much system testing is essential and            when you  should to stop testing  exhaustive testing where every possible program            execution sequence is tested is impossible testing therefore has to be based on a            subset of possible  test cases ideally software  companies should have policies  for            choosing this subset these policies might be based on general testing policies such            as  a  policy   that   all   program   statements  should   be  executed  at   least  once            alternatively  they may be based on experience of system usage and focus on testing            the features of the operational system for example            1 all     system functions that are accessed through menus should be tested            2 combinations     of functions  eg text formatting   that are accessed through the                   same menu must be tested            3 where    user input is provided  all functions  must be tested with both correct and                   incorrect  input                 it is clear from  experience with major  software products such as word processors            or  spreadsheets that similar  guidelines  are normally  used during  product  testing            when features of  the software are used in isolation  they normally  work  problems            arise as whittaker 2002 explains  when combinations of less commonly  used fea            tures have not  been tested together he gives the example  of how  in a commonly            used word  processor using footnotes  with  a multicolumn   layout  causes incorrect            layout of  the text                 automated system testing is usually more difficult  than automated unit or compo            nent testing automated  unit  testing relies  on predicting  the outputs then encoding            these predictions  in  a program  the prediction   is then  compared with   the result            however the  point of  implementing  a system may  be to generate outputs that  are            large or cannot be easily predicted you may be able to examine an output and check            its credibility   without necessarily being able to create it in advance82 testdriven                    development            testdriven development  tdd  is  an approach to program  development in  which            you  interleave  testing  and code  development  beck  2002  jeffries  and melnik            2007  essentially you  develop  the code incrementally  along  with  a test for  that            increment  you dont  move on  to the  next increment  until  the code that  you have            developed passes its test testdriven development  was introduced as part  of agile            methods such as extreme programming however it can also be used in plandriven            development processes239222 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing

  functionality and                                                                                                                                        refactorfigure 89 testdrivendevelopment                                       the  fundamental tdd  process is shown in  figure  89 the steps in the process                                   are as follows                                   1 you    start  by identifying    the increment  of  functionality   that is  required  this                                          should normally  be small and implementable in a few lines of  code                                   2 you    write  a test for this  functionality  and implement  this as an automated test                                          this  means that the test can be executed and will  report  whether or  not it  has                                          passed or failed                                   3 you    then  run the test  along with  all  other  tests that have been implemented                                          initially   you have not implemented  the functionality   so the new  test will  fail                                          this is deliberate as it shows that the test adds something to the test set                                   4 you    then  implement  the  functionality   and  rerun  the test this  may  involve                                          refactoring existing code to improve it and add new code to whats already there                                   5 once    all tests run successfully you move on to implementing  the next chunk of                                          functionality                                       an  automated testing environment  such as the junit  environment that supports                                   java program testing massol and husted 2003 is essential for  tdd  as the code                                   is developed in very small increments you have to be able to run every test each time                                   that you add functionality  or refactor the program therefore the tests are embedded                                   in a separate program that runs the tests and invokes the system that is being tested                                   using this approach it is possible to run hundreds of separate tests in a few seconds                                       a  strong argument for testdriven development is that it helps programmers clarify                                   their ideas of what a code segment is actually supposed to do to write a test you need                                   to understand what  is intended  as this understanding  makes it  easier to write  the                                   required code of course if  you have incomplete knowledge  or understanding then                                   testdriven development wont help if  you dont know  enough to write the tests you                                   wont develop the required code for example if your computation involves division                                   you should check that you are not dividing the numbers by zero if you forget to write                                   a test for this then the code to check will never be included in the program                                       as  well  as better problem  understanding other  benefits of  testdriven develop                                   ment are                                   1 code    coverage in principle   every code segment that you write  should have at                                          least one associated test therefore you can be confident that all of the code in240                                                                      82 \\x02 testdriven   development 223       the system has actually been executed code is tested as it is written so defects       are discovered early in the development process2 regression   testing a test suite is developed incrementally as a program is devel       oped you can always run regression tests to check that changes to the program       have not introduced new bugs3 simplified    debugging when a test fails it  should be obvious where the problem       lies the newly written  code needs to be checked and modified you do not need       to use debugging tools to  locate the problem  reports of the use of  testdriven       development suggest that it is hardly ever necessary to use an automated debug       ger in testdriven development martin  20074 system   documentation the tests themselves act as a form of documentation that       describe what the code should be doing reading the tests can make it easier to       understand the code    one of  the most important  benefits of  testdriven development is  that it  reducesthe costs of regression testing regression testing involves running test sets that havesuccessfully executed after changes have been made to a system the regression testchecks that these changes have not introduced new bugs into the system and that thenew code interacts  as expected with  the existing  code regression testing  is veryexpensive and often impractical  when  a system is manually  tested as the costs intime and effort are very high in such situations you have to try and choose the mostrelevant tests to rerun and it is easy to miss important tests    however automated testing which  is fundamental to testfirst  development dramatically   reduces the  costs of  regression  testing  existing   tests  may  be rerunquickly and cheaply after  making a change to a system in testfirst development allexisting tests must run  successfully before any  further functionality   is added as  aprogrammer you can be confident that the new functionality that you have added hasnot caused or revealed problems with existing code    testdriven  development is of most  use in new software development  where thefunctionality   is either  implemented  in  new code or  by using  welltested  standardlibraries if  you are reusing large code components or legacy systems then you needto write  tests for  these systems as a whole testdriven  development  may also beineffective with  multithreaded  systems the different threads may be interleaved atdifferent times in  different test runs and so may produce different results    if  you use testdriven development you still  need a system testing process to validate the system that is to check that it meets the requirements of all  of the systemstakeholders system testing also tests performance reliability  and checks that thesystem does not do things  that it  shouldnt do  such as produce unwanted outputsetc andrea  2007 suggests how  testing tools  can be extended  to integrate  someaspects of system testing with tdd    testdriven  development has proved  to be a successful  approach for small  andmediumsized projects generally programmers who have adopted this approach arehappy with  it  and find  it a  more productive  way to  develop software  jeffries and241224 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing                                   melnik  2007 in some trials it has been shown to lead to improved code quality in                                   others the results have been inconclusive however there is no evidence that tdd                                   leads to poorer quality code                      83 release                testing                                   release testing  is the  process of  testing  a particular   release of  a system  that  is                                   intended for use outside of the development team normally the system release is for                                   customers and users in a complex project  however the release could be for  other                                   teams that are developing related systems for software products the release could                                   be for product management who then prepare it for sale                                       there  are two important  distinctions  between release testing and system testing                                   during the development process                                   1 a    separate team that has not been involved in the system development should be                                          responsible for release testing                                   2 system   testing by  the development team should focus on discovering bugs in the                                          system defect testing the objective of release testing is to check that the system                                          meets its requirements and is good enough for external use validation testing                                       the  primary goal  of the release testing process is to convince the supplier of  the                                   system that it is good enough for  use if so it  can be released as a product or deliv                                   ered to the customer release testing therefore has to show that the system delivers                                   its specified  functionality  performance and dependability  and that it  does not fail                                   during normal  use it  should take into  account all  of  the system requirements not                                   just the requirements of the endusers of the system                                       release testing is usually a blackbox testing process where tests are derived from                                   the system specification  the system is treated as a black  box whose behavior  can                                   only be determined by studying  its inputs and the related outputs another name for                                   this is functional   testing socalled because the tester is only concerned with func                                   tionality  and not the implementation of  the software                     831 requirementsbased               testing                                   a general principle  of  good requirements engineering  practice is that requirements                                   should be testable that  is the requirement  should  be written  so that a test can  be                                   designed for that requirement a tester can then check that the requirement has been                                   satisfied requirementsbased testing therefore is a systematic approach to test case                                   design  where  you  consider  each  requirement   and  derive  a set  of  tests  for  it                                   requirementsbased testing is validation  rather than defect testing—you  are trying                                   to demonstrate that the system has properly implemented its requirements242                                                                                                    83 \\x02 release   testing 225                   for example  consider related  requirements  for  the mhcpms   introduced  in              chapter 1 which are concerned with checking  for drug allergies                   if a patient is known to be allergic to any particular   medication then prescrip                   tion of  that medication  shall result  in a warning  message being issued to the                   system user                       if  a prescriber  chooses to ignore  an allergy  warning  they shall provide  a                   reason why this has been ignored                   to check if these requirements have been satisfied you may need to develop sev              eral related tests              1 set    up a patient record with  no known allergies  prescribe medication for aller                     gies that are known to exist  check that a warning message is not issued by the                     system              2 set    up a patient record with a known allergy prescribe the medication to that the                     patient is allergic  to and check that the warning is issued by the system              3 set    up  a patient record  in which  allergies  to two  or more  drugs are recorded                     prescribe both of  these drugs separately and check that the correct warning for                     each drug is issued              4 prescribe    two drugs  that the patient is allergic  to check that  two warnings  are                     correctly  issued              5 prescribe    a drug that issues a warning and overrule that warning check that the                     system requires the user to provide information explaining why  the warning was                     overruled                   you can see from this that testing a requirement does not mean just writing a sin              gle test you normally have to write  several tests to ensure that you have coverage of              the requirement you should also maintain traceability records of your requirements              based testing which link  the tests to the specific requirements that are being tested832 scenario          testing              scenario testing is an approach to release testing where you devise typical scenarios              of use and use these to develop test cases for the system a scenario is  a story that              describes one way in which  the system might be used scenarios should be realistic              and real system users should be able to relate to them if you have used scenarios as              part of the requirements engineering process described in chapter 4 then you may              be able to reuse these as testing scenarios                   in a short  paper on scenario testing  kaner 2003  suggests that a scenario test              should be  a narrative story  that is  credible and  fairly  complex  it  should motivate              stakeholders that is they should relate to the scenario and believe that it is important243226 chapter        8 \\x02

are not suffering from  medication side effects          on a day for home visits kate logs into the mhcpms and uses it to print her schedule of home visits for that     day along with summary information about  the patients to be visited she requests that the records for these     patients be downloaded  to her laptop she is prompted for her key phrase to encrypt the records on the laptop          one of the  patients that she visits is jim who is being treated with  medication for depression jim feels that     the medication  is helping him but  believes that it has the side effect of keeping  him awake at night kate looks     up jims record and is prompted  for her key phrase to decrypt the record she checks the drug prescribed and     queries its side effects sleeplessness is a known side effect so she notes the problem in jims record and     suggests that he visits the clinic to have his medication changed he agrees so kate enters a prompt to call him     when she gets back to the clinic  to make an appointment  with a physician she ends the consultation and the     system reencrypts jims record          after finishing her consultations kate returns to  the clinic and

prop              erties such as performance and reliability performance tests have to be designed to              ensure that the system can process its intended load this usually involves running a              series of tests where  you increase the load  until  the system performance  becomes              unacceptable                   as with   other  types  of  testing  performance   testing  is  concerned  both with              demonstrating that the system meets its requirements and discovering problems and              defects  in   the  system  to  test  whether   performance   requirements   are  being              achieved you may  have to construct an operational  profile  an  operational profile              see chapter 15 is a set of tests that reflect the actual mix of  work that will   be han              dled by the system therefore if  90 of  the transactions in a system are of type a              5 of  type b and the remainder  of types c d  and e then you have to design the              operational profile   so that the vast majority  of  tests are of type  a  otherwise you              will  not get an accurate test of the operational performance  of the system                   this approach of course is  not necessarily the best approach for defect testing              experience has shown  that an effective  way  to discover  defects is  to design  tests              around the limits of  the system in performance testing this means stressing the sys              tem by  making demands that are outside  the design limits  of  the software  this is              known as stress testing  for example say you are testing a transaction processing              system that is  designed to process up to 300  transactions per second you start by              testing this system with  fewer than 300 transactions per second you then gradually              increase the load on the system beyond 300  transactions per second until it  is well              beyond the maximum  design load  of the system and the system fails  this  type of              testing has two functions              1 it     tests the failure behavior of  the system circumstances may arise through an                     unexpected combination of events where the load placed on the system exceeds                     the maximum  anticipated load in  these circumstances it is important  that sys                     tem failure should not cause data corruption or unexpected loss of user services                     stress testing checks that overloading  the system causes it to  failsoft   rather                     than collapse under its load              2 it    stresses the system and may cause defects to come to light that would not nor                     mally  be discovered although it can be argued that these defects are unlikely to                     cause system failures in  normal  usage there may be unusual combinations  of                     normal circumstances that the stress testing replicates                   stress testing is particularly relevant to distributed systems based on a network of              processors these systems often exhibit  severe degradation when they  are heavily              loaded the  network  becomes swamped with  coordination   data that the  different              processes must exchange the processes become slower and slower as they wait for              the required data from  other  processes stress testing helps you discover when the              degradation begins so that you  can add checks to the  system to reject  transactions              beyond this point245228 chapter    8 \\x02 software    testing                      84 user             testing                                   user or customer testing is a stage in the testing process in which users or customers                                   provide input and advice on system testing this may involve  formally  testing a sys                                   tem that has been commissioned from an external supplier  or could be an informal                                   process where users experiment with a new software product to see if they like it and                                   that it does what they need user testing is essential even when comprehensive sys                                   tem and release testing have been carried out the reason for this is  that influences                                   from  the users working  environment have a major  effect on  the reliability  perfor                                   mance usability and robustness of a system                                        it is practically  impossible for  a system developer to replicate the systems work                                   ing environment as tests in the developers environment are inevitably artificial  for                                   example a system that is intended for use in a hospital is used in a clinical  environ                                   ment where other  things are going  on such  as patient emergencies conversations                                   with relatives etc these all affect the use of a system but developers cannot include                                   them in their testing environment                                        in practice there are three different types of user testing                                   1 alpha     testing where users of the software  work with  the development team to                                          test the software at the developers site                                   2 beta    testing where a release of the software is made available to users to allow                                          them to  experiment  and to raise problems  that they  discover with  the  system                                          developers                                   3 acceptance    testing where customers test a system to decide whether or not it is                                          ready to be accepted from the system developers and deployed in the customer                                          environment                                        in alpha testing users and developers work together to test a system as it is being                                   developed this means that the users can identify  problems  and issues that are not                                   readily apparent to  the development testing team developers can only  really  work                                   from the requirements but these often do not reflect other factors that affect the prac                                   tical use of the software users can therefore provide information  about practice that                                   helps with the design of more realistic  tests                                        alpha testing  is often  used when developing  software products  that are sold as                                   shrinkwrapped systems users of  these products may be willing  to  get involved in                                   the alpha testing process because this gives them early information   about new sys                                   tem features that they can exploit it also reduces the risk that unanticipated changes                                   to the software will  have disruptive effects on their  business however alpha testing                                   may also be used when custom software is being developed agile methods such as                                   xp advocate user involvement   in the  development process and that  users should

also a form of  marketing—                                   customers learn about their system and what it can do for them                                        acceptance testing is  an inherent part of  custom systems development it  takes                                   place after release testing it involves a customer formally testing a system to decide                                   whether or not it should be accepted from the system developer acceptance implies                                   that payment should be made for the system                                        there are six stages in the acceptance testing process as shown in figure  811                                   they are                                   1 define     acceptance criteria this

           should be part of  the system contract and be agreed between the customer and                                          the developer in practice however it  can be difficult  to define

acceptance criteria  have been established tests                                          have to be designed to check whether or not a system is acceptable acceptance                                          tests should aim  to test both  the functional  and  nonfunctional  characteristics                                          eg performance of the system they should ideally provide complete

criteria there  is often scope for  argument about whether                                          or not a test shows that a criterion has definitely been met247230 chapter    8 \\x02 software

the actual environment where the  system will                                          be used but this  may be  disruptive  and impractical  therefore  a user testing                                          environment may  have to be set up to run these tests it is difficult   to automate                                          this process as part of the acceptance tests may involve testing  the interactions                                          between endusers and the system some training of endusers may be required                                   5 negotiate   test results it is very unlikely that all of the defined acceptance tests will                                          pass and that there will be no problems with  the system if this  is the case then                                          acceptance testing is complete and the system can be handed over more com                                          monly some problems will   be discovered in such cases the developer and the                                          customer have to negotiate to decide if the system is good enough to be put into                                          use they must also agree on the developers response to identified problems                                   6 rejectaccept     system this  stage involves  a meeting  between  the developers                                           and the customer to decide on whether or not the system should be accepted if                                          the system  is not  good enough for  use then  further  development is  required                                          to fix  the identified   problems once complete  the acceptance testing phase is                                          repeated                                        in agile methods such as xp acceptance testing has a rather different meaning in                                   principle  it shares the notion that  users should decide whether or not the system is                                   acceptable however in xp the user is part of the development team ie he or she                                   is an alpha  tester and provides  the system requirements  in  terms of  user stories                                    he or she is also responsible for defining  the tests which decide whether or  not the                                   developed software supports the user story the tests are automated and development                                   does not proceed until the story acceptance tests have passed there is therefore no                                   separate acceptance testing activity                                        as i have discussed in chapter 3 one problem with user involvement is ensuring                                   that the user who is embedded in the development team is a typical  user with  gen                                   eral knowledge of how the system will  be used it can be difficult to find  such a user                                   and so  the  acceptance tests  may  actually   not  be a  true  reflection   of  practice                                   furthermore the requirement for  automated testing severely limits  the flexibility   of                                   testing interactive systems for such systems acceptance testing may require groups                                   of endusers to use the system as if it was part of their everyday work                                        you might think  that acceptance testing is a clearcut contractual  issue if a sys                                   tem does not pass its acceptance tests then it should not  be accepted and payment                                   should not be made however the  reality is  more complex customers want  to use                                   the software  as soon as they can because of the benefits  of its  immediate  deploy                                   ment  they  may  have  bought  new  hardware  trained   staff  and  changed  their                                   processes they may  be willing   to accept  the software  irrespective  of problems                                   because the costs of not  using  the software  are greater than the  costs of working                                   around the problems  therefore  the outcome  of  negotiations may  be conditional                                   acceptance of the system the customer may accept the system so that deployment                                   can begin the system provider  agrees to repair urgent problems and deliver  a new                                   version to the customer as quickly as possible248

it inevitablyhas to change if it is to remain  useful business changes and changes to user expectations generate new requirements  for the  existing  software parts of  the softwaremay have to be modified to correct  errors that are found in operation to  adapt it forchanges to its hardware and software  platform  and to improve  its  performance orother nonfunctional characteristics    software   evolution   is  important   because organizations   have  invested  largeamounts of money in their software and are now completely dependent on these systems their  systems are critical  business assets and they have to invest  in  systemchange to maintain  the value of  these assets consequently most large companiesspend more on  maintaining  existing  systems  than on new  systems developmentbased on an informal industry poll erlikh  2000 suggests that 85–90 of organizational software costs are evolution costs other surveys suggest that about twothirdsof software  costs are evolution  costs for sure the costs of  software  change are alarge part of the it budget for all  companies    software  evolution   may  be triggered  by  changing  business requirements   byreports of software  defects or by  changes to other systems in  a software systemsenvironment hopkins and jenkins 2008 have coined the term brownfield softwaredevelopment to describe situations in which  software systems have to be developedand managed in an environment where they  are dependent on many other softwaresystems    therefore   the  evolution  of   a system  can  rarely  be considered   in  isolationchanges to the environment   lead to system  change that may  then trigger  furtherenvironmental changes of course the fact that systems have to evolve in a systemsrich  environment often increases the difficulties  and costs of  evolution as  well  asunderstanding and analyzing an impact  of  a proposed change on the system itselfyou may  also have to assess how this may  affect other  systems in the operationalenvironment    useful  software systems often have a very long lifetime for example large military or infrastructure systems such as air traffic control systems may have a lifetimeof 30 years or  more business systems are often more than  10 years old softwarecost a lot of money so a company has to use a software system for many years to geta return  on its  investment  obviously  the  requirements  of  the installed  systemschange as the business and its environment change therefore new releases of thesystems incorporating changes and updates are usually created at regular intervals    you  should  therefore  think  of  software  engineering  as a spiral  process withrequirements design implementation and testing  going on throughout  the lifetimeof the system figure 91 you start by creating release 1 of the system once delivered changes are proposed and the development of release 2 starts almost immediately in fact the need for evolution  may become obvious even before the system isdeployed so that later releases of the software may be under development before thecurrent version has been released    this  model of software evolution  implies that a single organization is responsiblefor both  the initial   software development  and the evolution  of  the software  most253236 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution

different approach is commonly used a software company develops software for a                                   customer and the customers own development staff then take over the system they                                   are responsible for  software evolution  alternatively   the software  customer might                                   issue a separate contract to a different company for system support and evolution                                        in this case there are likely to be discontinuities in the spiral process requirements                                   and design

involve program  understanding especially if  the original  system developers are not                                   responsible for  change implementation  during  this program  understanding phase                                   you have to understand how the program is structured how it  delivers functionality                                   and how the proposed change might affect the program you need this understanding                                   to make sure that the implemented  change does not cause new problems when it is                                   introduced

                            able to follow  the formal  change analysis process rather than modify  the require                                   ments and design you make an emergency fix to  the

      you chose a quick and workable solution  rather than the best solution as far as sys                                   tem structure is  concerned this accelerates the process of software ageing  so that                                   future changes become progressively more difficult  and maintenance costs increase                                       ideally  when emergency code repairs are made the change request should remain                                   outstanding after the code faults have been fixed it can then be reimplemented more                                   carefully  after further analysis of  course the code of the repair may be reused an                                   alternative  better solution  to  the problem  may  be discovered when  more time

are often  forgotten   and if   further  system                                   changes are made it then becomes unrealistic to redo the emergency repairs                                       agile

approach has been used for development but the evolution                                          team prefers to use agile methods in this case the evolution team may  have to                                          start from  scratch developing automated tests and the code  in the system may                                          not have been refactored and simplified  as is expected in agile development in                                          this case some reengineering may be required to improve the code before it can                                          be used in an

business needs new                                   releases of the system are essential for the system to provide business value                                       the  first law  states that system maintenance is an inevitable process as the sys                                   tems environment changes new requirements emerge and the system must be mod                                   ified  when the modified  system is reintroduced  to the environment  this promotes                                   more environmental changes so the evolution process starts again                                       the second law states that as a system is changed its structure is degraded the only                                   way to avoid this happening is to invest in  preventative maintenance you spend time                                   improving  the software structure without  adding to its  functionality  obviously  this                                   means additional costs over and above those of implementing required system changes258                                                                                                   92 \\x02 program   evolution

is  perhaps the  most  interesting  and  the  most contentious   offigure 97 lehmanslaws                           lehmans  laws it  suggests that large systems have a dynamic  of their  own  that is                                   established at an early stage in the development process this determines the gross                                   trends of the system maintenance process and limits the number of  possible system                                   changes lehman and belady suggest that this law is a consequence of structural fac                                   tors that  influence  and  constrain  system change  and organizational   factors that                                   affect the evolution process                                       the  structural factors that affect the third  law come from  the complexity  of large                                   systems as you change and extend a program its structure tends to degrade this is                                   true of all types of  system not just software and it occurs because you are adapting                                   a structure  intended for  one purpose for  a different   purpose this  degradation  if                                   unchecked makes it  more and more  difficult   to make  further  changes to the pro                                   gram making   small  changes reduces the extent of  structural  degradation  and so                                   lessens the risks of  causing serious system dependability  problems if  you  try and                                   make large changes there is a high probability  that these will  introduce new  faults                                   these then inhibit further  program changes                                       the  organizational factors that  affect the third  law reflect  the fact that large sys                                   tems are usually  produced by  large organizations  these companies have internal                                   bureaucracies that set the change budget for each system and control  the decision                                   making  process companies have to make decisions  on the risks  and value of  the259242 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution                                   changes and the costs involved such decisions take time to make and sometimes it                                   takes longer to decide on the changes to be made than change implementation the                                   speed of the organizations decisionmaking  processes therefore governs the rate of                                   change of the system                                       lehmans  fourth  law  suggests that most large programming   projects work  in  a                                   saturated state that is a change to resources or staffing has imperceptible  effects                                   on the longterm evolution of  the system this is consistent with the third law which                                   suggests that program evolution  is  largely  independent of  management decisions                                   this law  confirms  that  large software  development  teams are often  unproductive                                   because communication overheads dominate the work of the team                                       lehmans   fifth  law  is  concerned  with  the change  increments  in  each system                                   release adding  new  functionality   to  a system inevitably   introduces  new system                                   faults the  more functionality   added in each release the more faults there will   be                                   therefore a large increment  in functionality   in  one system release means that this                                   will  have  to be followed   by a  further  release in which  the  new system  faults are                                   repaired relatively  little  new functionality   should be included in  this release this                                   law suggests that you  should not budget for  large functionality   increments in  each                                   release without taking into  account the need for fault repair                                       the  first  five laws  were in lehmans  initial  proposals the remaining  laws were                                   added after further work  the sixth and seventh laws are similar  and essentially say                                   that users of software  will   become increasingly unhappy  with  it  unless it is  main                                   tained and new  functionality   is added to it  the  final  law reflects  the most  recent                                   work on  feedback processes although it is not yet  clear how this  can be applied in                                   practical software development                                       lehmans   observations  seem generally   sensible  they  should  be  taken  into                                   account when planning the maintenance process it may be that business considera                                   tions require  them to be  ignored at any  one time for  example for  marketing rea                                   sons it may be necessary to make several major system changes in a single release                                   the likely  consequences of this are that one or more releases devoted to error repair                                   are likely  to be required  you often  see this in personal computer  software when a                                   major new release of an application is often quickly followed  by a bug repair update                       93 software                 maintenance                                   software maintenance is the general process of changing a system after it  has been                                   delivered the term is usually applied to custom software in which  separate develop                                   ment groups are involved before and after delivery the changes made to the software                                   may be simple changes to correct  coding errors more extensive changes to correct                                   design errors or significant  enhancements to correct specification  errors or accom                                   modate new requirements changes are implemented by modifying  existing  system                                   components and where necessary by adding new components to the system                                       there are three different  types of software maintenance260                                                                          93 \\x02 software    maintenance 2431 fault    repairs coding  errors are usually relatively cheap to correct design errors       are more expensive as they may involve rewriting several program components       requirements errors are the most expensive to  repair because of the extensive       system redesign which may be necessary2 environmental     adaptation this    type of  maintenance  is required  when  some       aspect of the systems environment such as the hardware the platform operating       system or  other support  software  changes the  application  system  must be       modified to  adapt it to cope with these environmental changes3 functionality     addition this   type of maintenance is necessary when the system       requirements change in response to organizational or business change the scale       of the changes required to the software is often  much greater than for the other       types of maintenance    in  practice  there is  not a clearcut  distinction   between these types of  maintenance when you adapt the system to a new environment you may add functionalityto take advantage of new environmental features software faults  are often exposedbecause users use the system in unanticipated ways changing the system to accommodate their way of working  is the best way to fix  these faults    these types of maintenance are generally  recognized but different  people sometimes give  them different  names corrective   maintenance  is universally   used torefer to maintenance  for fault  repair  however adaptive  maintenance sometimesmeans adapting to a new environment and sometimes means adapting the software tonew requirements perfective  maintenance  sometimes means perfecting the  software by implementing   new requirements  in other  cases it means maintaining  thefunctionality  of the system but improving  its structure and its performance becauseof this naming uncertainty i have avoided the use of all of these terms in this chapter    there  have been several studies of software maintenance which  have looked  atthe relationships   between maintenance  and  development  and between  differentmaintenance activities krogstie et al 2005  lientz and swanson 1980 nosek andpalvia 1990  sousa 1998 because of  differences  in terminology   the details  ofthese studies cannot be compared in  spite of changes in  technology  and differentapplication domains it seems that there has been remarkably little change in the distribution of  evolution effort  since the 1980s    the surveys broadly agree that software maintenance takes up a higher proportionof it  budgets than  new development  roughly  twothirds   maintenance onethirddevelopment  they also  agree that more  of  the maintenance  budget is  spent onimplementing  new requirements than on fixing  bugs figure  98 shows an approximate distribution of maintenance costs the specific percentages will obviously varyfrom one organization  to another but universally  repairing system faults  is not themost expensive maintenance activity evolving the system to cope with new environments and new or changed requirements consumes most maintenance effort    the  relative costs of maintenance and new  development vary from  one application domain to another guimaraes 1983 found that the maintenance costs for business application systems are broadly  comparable  with  system development costs261244 chapter    9 \\x02 software

unlikely  that the cost dis                                   tributions for  different types of  system have significantly changed                                       it  is usually cost effective to invest effort in designing and implementing a system to                                   reduce the costs of future changes adding new functionality after delivery is expensive

specification the use of objectoriented development and                                   configuration management contribute to maintenance cost reduction                                       figure

change however in  planbased development the reality   is that additional  invest                              ment in code improvement is rarely made during development this is mostly  due to                              the ways most organizations run  their budgets investing in  maintainability  leads to                              shortterm cost increases which are measurable unfortunately the longterm gains                              cant be measured at the same time so companies are reluctant to spend money for an                              unknown future return                                  it  is usually more expensive to add functionality after a system is in operation than                              it is to implement the same functionality during development the reasons for this are                              1 team   stability after    a system has been delivered it is  normal for  the develop                                     ment team to  be broken up  and for people  to work  on new  projects the new                                     team or the individuals   responsible for system maintenance do  not understand                                     the system or the  background to system design decisions  they need to spend                                     time understanding the existing system before implementing  changes to it                              2 poor    development practice the contract to maintain a system is usually separate                                     from  the system development contract the maintenance contract may be given                                     to a different   company rather than  the original  system developer this  factor                                     along with the lack of  team stability means that there is no incentive for a devel                                     opment team to write maintainable software if  a development team can cut cor                                     ners to save effort during development it is worthwhile  for them to do so even if                                     this means that the software is more difficult  to change in the future                              3 staff   skills maintenance staff are often relatively inexperienced and unfamiliar with                                     the application domain maintenance has a poor image among software engineers                                     it is seen as a lessskilled process than system development and is often allocated to                                     the most junior staff furthermore old systems may be written in obsolete program                                     ming languages the maintenance staff may not have much experience of develop                                     ment in these languages and must learn these languages to maintain the system263246 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution                   documentation     system documentation can help the maintenance process by providing maintainers with information about the     structure and organization of the system and the features that it offers to system users although proponents of     agile approaches such as xp suggest that the code should be the principal documentation higherlevel design     models and information about dependencies and constraints can make it easier to understand and make     changes to the code     i have written a separate chapter on documentation that you can download

efficiency  rather  than understandability  system  docu                                          mentation may be lost or inconsistent old systems may not have been subject to                                          stringent  configuration  management so time  is often  wasted finding   the right                                          versions of system components to change                                        the first  three of these problems stem from the fact that many  organizations still                                   consider development and maintenance to be separate activities maintenance is seen                                   as a secondclass activity and there is no incentive to spend money during development                                   to reduce the costs of system change the only longterm solution to this problem is to                                   accept that systems rarely have a defined lifetime but continue in use in some form                                   for an indefinite  period as  i suggested in the introduction you  should think of  sys                                   tems as evolving throughout their lifetime through a continual development process                                        the fourth issue the problem of degraded system structure is the easiest problem                                   to address software reengineering techniques described later in  this chapter may                                   be applied  to  improve  the system  structure  and understandability   architectural                                   transformations can adapt the system to new hardware refactoring can improve the                                   quality  of the system code and make it easier to change                     931 maintenance            prediction                                   managers hate surprises especially if  these result in  unexpectedly high  costs you                                   should therefore  try  to predict  what  system changes might  be proposed and what                                   parts of  the system are likely  to be the  most difficult   to maintain  you should also                                    try  to estimate the  overall maintenance  costs for  a system in a given  time  period                                   figure 910 shows these predictions and associated questions                                        predicting the number of change requests for a system requires an understanding                                   of the relationship  between the system and its external environment  some systems                                   have a very complex relationship with their external environment and changes to that264

interfaces the more likely  it  is that interface                                          changes will be required as new requirements are proposed                                   2 the   number of inherently volatile system requirements as i discussed in chapter 4                                          requirements that reflect organizational  policies and procedures are likely  to be                                          more volatile than requirements that are based on stable domain characteristics                                   3 the    business  processes in  which  the  system is  used as  business processes                                          evolve they generate system change requests the more business processes that                                          use a

                     kozlov  et al 2008 it  is not surprising  that these studies have found that the more                                   complex a system or  component the more expensive it  is to maintain  complexity                                   measurements are particularly  useful  in  identifying   program components  that are                                   likely  to be expensive to maintain kafura  and reddy 1987 examined a number of                                   system components and found that maintenance effort tended to be focused on a small                                   number of complex components to reduce maintenance costs therefore you should                                   try to replace complex system components with simpler alternatives                                        after a system has been put into service you  may be able to use process data to                                   help  predict  maintainability    examples  of  process metrics  that  can  be used for                                   assessing maintainability are as follows265248 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution                                   1 number    of  requests for corrective  maintenance an  increase in  the number  of                                          bug and failure  reports may indicate that more  errors are being introduced into

                         2 average    time required for  impact analysis this  reflects the number of  program                                          components that are affected by the change request if this time increases it implies                                          more and more components are affected and maintainability is decreasing                                   3 average    time taken to  implement a change request this is  not the same as the                                          time for  impact analysis although it  may correlate with it  this is the amount of                                          time that you  need to modify  the system and its documentation after you  have                                          assessed which components  are affected  an  increase in  the time  needed to                                          implement a change may indicate a decline in maintainability                                   4 number    of  outstanding change requests an  increase in this  number over time                                          may imply  a decline in maintainability                                       you  use predicted information  about change requests and predictions about sys                                   tem maintainability  to predict maintenance costs most managers combine this infor                                   mation with  intuition   and experience to estimate costs the cocomo  2 model  of                                   cost estimation boehm et al 2000  discussed in chapter 24 suggests that an esti                                   mate for software maintenance effort can be based on the effort to understand exist                                   ing code and the effort to develop the new code                    932 software           reengineering                                   as i  discussed in  the previous  section  the process of  system  evolution  involves                                   understanding  the program  that  has to be changed  and then implementing   these                                   changes however many systems especially  older legacy  systems are difficult  to                                   understand and change the programs may have been optimized for performance or                                   space utilization  at the expense of  understandability  or over time  the initial   pro                                   gram structure may have been corrupted by a series of changes                                       to  make legacy software  systems easier to maintain  you  can reengineer these                                   systems to improve their structure and understandability reengineering may involve                                   redocumenting the system refactoring the system architecture translating programs                                   to a modern programming  language and modifying  and updating  the structure and                                   values of the  systems data the functionality   of  the software  is not  changed and                                   normally you should  try to avoid making  major changes to the system architecture                                       there are two important  benefits from  reengineering rather than replacement                                   1 reduced    risk there  is  a high  risk in  redeveloping  businesscritical   software                                          errors may  be made in the  system specification  or there may  be

                      figure  911 is  a general  model  of the  reengineering  process the input  to  the                                   process is a legacy program and the output is an improved  and restructured version                                   of the same program the activities in this  reengineering process are as follows                                   1 source   code translation using   a translation tool the program is converted from                                          an old programming  language to a more modern  version of the same language

          you dont need source code translation if you still use the applications programming                                   language if you can do all reengineering automatically then recovering

program change during system reengineering                                        to make the reengineered system interoperate with  the  new software you  may                                   have to develop adaptor services as discussed in chapter 19 these hide the original                                   interfaces of  the software system and present new betterstructured  interfaces that                                   can be used by  other components  this process of  legacy  system wrapping  is  an                                   important technique for  developing largescale reusable services                                        the costs of  reengineering obviously   depend on the extent  of  the work  that is                                   carried out there is  a spectrum of possible approaches to reengineering as shown                                   in figure  912 costs  increase from  left  to right  so that source code  translation  is                                   the cheapest option  reengineering  as part of  architectural  migration   is the most                                   expensive                                        the problem with  software reengineering is that there are practical limits  to how                                   much you can improve a system by reengineering it isnt possible for example to con                                   vert a system written using a functional approach to an objectoriented system major                                   architectural changes or radical reorganizing of the system data management cannot be                                   carried out  automatically  so they are very  expensive although  reengineering can                                   improve maintainability the reengineered system will probably not be as maintainable                                   as a new system developed using modern software engineering methods                     933 preventative           maintenance       by  refactoring                                   refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degra                                   dation through change opdyke and johnson 1990 it means modifying a program to                                   improve  its structure  to reduce its complexity   or to make  it easier to  understand                                   refactoring is sometimes considered to be limited to objectoriented development but                                   the principles can be applied to any development approach when you refactor a pro                                   gram you should not add functionality  but  should concentrate on program improve                                   ment you can therefore think of refactoring as preventative maintenance that reduces                                   the problems of future change268

reengineering takes placeafter a system has been maintained for some time and maintenance costs are increasing you use automated tools to process and reengineer a legacy system to create anew system  that  is  more maintainable   refactoring   is  a continuous   process ofimprovement throughout  the  development and evolution  process it  is intended  toavoid the structure and code degradation that increases the costs and difficulties  ofmaintaining a system    refactoring  is  an inherent part of  agile  methods such as extreme programmingbecause these methods are based around change program quality is therefore liable todegrade quickly so agile developers frequently  refactor their programs  to avoid thisdegradation the emphasis on regression testing in agile methods lowers the risk ofintroducing new errors through refactoring any  errors that are introduced should bedetectable as previously successful tests should then fail however refactoring is notdependent on other agile activities and can be used with any approach to development    fowler  et al 1999  suggest that there are stereotypical situations he calls thembad smells  in  which  the code  of a program  can be improved  examples  of badsmells that can be improved through refactoring include1 duplicate     code the  same of  very  similar  code may  be included  at  different       places in a program this can be removed and implemented as a single method       or function  that is called as required2 long    methods if  a method is too  long it  should be redesigned as a number of       shorter methods3 switch    case  statements these often  involve   duplication   where the  switch       depends on the type  of  some value the  switch  statements may be  scattered       around a program  in  objectoriented  languages you can  often use polymor       phism to achieve the same thing4 data    clumping data  clumps occur when the same group of data items fields in       classes parameters in methods reoccur in several places in  a program these       can often be replaced with an object encapsulating all of the data5 speculative     generality this   occurs  when developers  include  generality   in a       program in case it is required in future  this can often simply  be removed    fowler  in his book  and website also suggests some primitive  refactoring transformations that can be used singly or together to deal with the bad smells examplesof these transformations include extract method where you remove duplication  andcreate a new  method  consolidate  conditional   expression  where  you  replace asequence of tests with a single test and pull  up method where you  replace similarmethods in subclasses with a single method in a super class interactive developmentenvironments  such as eclipse  include  refactoring   support in  their  editors  thismakes it  easier to find  dependent  parts of  a program  that have  to be changed  toimplement the refactoring269252 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution                                       refactoring   carried  out  during  program  development  is  an effective  way  to                                   reduce the longterm  maintenance costs of a program however if  you  take over a                                   program for  maintenance whose structure  has been significantly  degraded then  it                                   may be practically impossible  to refactor the code alone you may also have to think                                   about design refactoring which  is likely   to be a more expensive and difficult  prob                                   lem design  refactoring  involves identifying   relevant design patterns discussed in

under                                   stand that the system development process is a whole lifecycle  process and that an                                   artificial   separation between  software  development  and software  maintenance is                                   unhelpful however there are still many legacy systems that are critical business sys                                   tems these have to be extended and adapted to changing ebusiness practices                                       most  organizations usually have a portfolio  of  legacy systems that they use with                                   a limited  budget for maintaining  and upgrading these systems they have to decide                                   how to  get the  best return  on  their  investment  this  involves  making  a realistic                                   assessment of their legacy systems and then deciding on the most appropriate strat                                   egy for evolving  these systems there are four strategic options                                   1 scrap    the system completely this  option should be chosen when the  system is                                          not  making  an effective  contribution   to  business processes this commonly                                          occurs when  business processes have changed since the system was installed                                          and are no longer reliant on the legacy system                                   2 leave     the system  unchanged and  continue   with  regular   maintenance this                                          option should be chosen when the system is still required but is fairly  stable and                                          the system users make relatively few change requests                                   3 reengineer    the  system to improve  its  maintainability this     option  should  be                                          chosen when the system quality has been degraded by change and where a new                                          change to the system is still being proposed this process may include develop                                          ing new interface  components so that the original  system can work  with other                                          newer systems                                   4 replace    all or  part of  the system with a new system this option should be cho                                          sen when factors such as new hardware mean that the old system cannot

in many cases an evolutionary replacement                                          strategy can be adopted in which major system components are replaced by off                                          theshelf systems with other components reused wherever possible270                                                                                                   94 \\x02 legacy    system

           naturally  these options are not exclusive when a system is composed of several                                   programs different options may  be applied to each program                                       when  you are assessing a legacy system you have to look  at it from  a business                                   perspective and a technical perspective warren 1998 from a business perspective                                   you have to decide whether or not the business really needs the system from a tech                                   nical perspective you have to assess the quality of the application  software and the                                   systems support software and hardware you then use a combination of the business                                   value and the system quality to  inform  your decision on  what to do with  the legacy                                   system                                       for  example  assume that an organization  has 10  legacy systems  you should                                   assess the quality and the business value of each of these systems you may then cre                                   ate a chart  showing relative  business value  and system  quality  this  is shown  in                                   figure 913                                       from  figure 913 you can see that there are four clusters of systems                                   1 low     quality  low  business value keeping  these systems  in operation  will   be                                          expensive and the rate of  the return to the  business will  be fairly  small these                                          systems should be scrapped                                   2 low    quality  high business value these systems are making an important busi                                          ness contribution so they cannot be scrapped however their low quality means                                          that it  is expensive to maintain them  these systems should be reengineered to                                          improve their quality  they may be replaced if a suitable offtheshelf system is                                          available                                   3 high     quality low  business value these are systems that dont contribute much                                          to the business but which may not be very expensive to maintain it is not worth                                          replacing  these systems so normal  system  maintenance may  be continued  if                                          expensive changes are not  required and the  system hardware remains  in use                                           if  expensive changes become necessary the software should be scrapped271254 chapter    9 \\x02 software    evolution                                   4 high     quality  high business value these systems have to be kept in  operation                                          however their  high quality  means that you dont  have to invest in  transforma                                          tion or system replacement normal  system maintenance should be continued                                       to  assess the business value of a system you have to identify system stakehold                                   ers such as endusers of the system and their managers and ask a series of questions                                   about the system there are four basic issues that you have to discuss                                   1 the    use of the system if systems are only used occasionally or by a small num                                          ber of  people they may have a low business value a  legacy system may have                                          been developed to meet a business need that has either changed or that can now                                          be met more effectively  in  other ways you  have to be careful however about                                          occasional but important use of systems for example in a university  a student                                          registration  system may only  be used at the beginning  of each academic year                                          however it is an essential system with a high business value                                   2 the    business processes that are supported when a system is introduced  busi                                          ness processes are designed to exploit the systems capabilities if the system is                                          inflexible  changing  these business processes may be impossible however as                                          the environment changes the original business processes may become obsolete                                          therefore a system may have a low business value because it forces the use of                                          inefficient  business processes                                   3 the    system dependability system dependability is not  only a technical problem                                          but also  a business problem if   a system is not  dependable and the problems                                          directly  affect  the business customers or mean that people  in the business are                                          diverted from other tasks to solve these problems the system has a low business                                          value                                   4 the    system outputs the key issue here is the importance of the system outputs to                                          the successful functioning of  the business if the business depends on these out                                          puts then the system has a high business value conversely if these outputs can                                          be easily generated in some other way or if the system produces outputs that are                                          rarely used then its business value may be low                                       for  example lets assume that a company provides a travel ordering  system that                                   is used by  staff  responsible  for  arranging  travel  they  can place  orders with   an                                   approved travel agent tickets  are then delivered  and the company  is invoiced  for                                   these however a business value assessment may reveal that this system is only used                                   for a fairly   small percentage of travel orders placed people making  travel arrange                                   ments find  it  cheaper and more  convenient  to deal  directly   with  travel  suppliers                                   through their  websites this  system may still  be used but there is  no real point  in                                   keeping it the same functionality  is available from  external systems                                       conversely say a company has developed a system that keeps track of all  previ                                   ous customer orders and automatically generates reminders for customers to reorder                                   goods this results in a large number of repeat orders and keeps customers satisfied272

      to  assess a  software   system   from   a technical    perspective   you  need  to  consider                                       both  the application    system  itself   and  the environment

thatthe most significant challenge that we face in software engineering isensuring that we can trust these systems to trust a system we must haveconfidence that it will be available when required and perform as expectedit must be secure so that our computers or data are not threatened by itthis means that issues of system dependability and security are often moreimportant than the details of system functionality this part of the book hastherefore been designed to introduce students and practising softwareengineers to the important topics of dependability and security   the first chapter in this section chapter 10 covers sociotechnical systems   which at first sight may not appear to have much to do with software   dependability however many security and dependability failures stem   from human and organizational causes and we cannot ignore these when   considering system dependability and security software engineers must   be aware of this and should not imagine that better techniques and tech   nology can ensure that our systems are completely dependable and secure   chapter 11 introduces the basic concepts of dependability and security and   explains the fundamental principles of avoidance detection and recovery   that are used to build dependable systems chapter 12 supplements   chapter 4 which covers requirements engineering with a discussion of   specific approaches that are used for deriving and specifying system279requirements for security and dependability i briefly introduce  the use offormal specification in chapter 12 and an additional chapter on this topicis available on the webchapters 13 and 14 are concerned with software engineering techniquesfor the development  of dependable and secure systems i cover dependability  engineering  and

dependability and  security i also explain  why it  is important  touse redundancy and diversity to  ensure that systems can cope with  failures and external attacks i introduce the  increasingly important  topic ofsoftware survivability  or resilience which  allows systems to  continue todeliver essential services while their security  is being threatenedfinally in this  section chapter 15 is  concerned with  dependability  andsecurity assurance i explain the use of static  analysis and model checking for  system verification   and fault  detection  these techniques  havebeen successfully used in critical  systems engineering i also  cover specific approaches to testing the dependability  and security of systems andexplain why a dependability case may be necessary to convince an external regulator that a system is safe and secure28010sociotechnical                                        systems            objectives            the objectives of this chapter are to introduce the concept of a            sociotechnical system—a system that includes people software            and hardware—and to show that you need to take a systems            perspective on security and dependability when you have read            this chapter you will            \\x02 know what is meant by a sociotechnical system and understand                the difference between a technical

sociotechnical     systems                                   in a computer  system the software  and the hardware are interdependent  without                                   hardware a software system is  an abstraction which  is simply  a  representation of                                   some human knowledge and ideas without software hardware is a set of inert elec                                   tronic  devices however if  you  put  them together to  form  a system you  create a                                   machine that can  carry out  complex computations  and deliver  the results  of these                                   computations to its environment                                       this  illustrates one of the fundamental characteristics of a system—it is more than                                   the sum of its  parts systems have properties that only become apparent when their                                   components are integrated and operate together therefore software  engineering is                                   not an isolated activity  but is an intrinsic  part of  more general systems engineering                                   processes software systems are not isolated systems but rather essential components                                   of more extensive systems that have some human social or organizational purpose                                       for  example the wilderness weather system software controls the instruments in a                                   weather station it communicates with  other software systems and is a part of wider                                   national and international weather forecasting systems as well as hardware and soft                                   ware these systems include processes for forecasting the weather people who operate                                   the system and analyze its outputs the system also includes  the organizations that                                   depend on the system to help them provide weather forecasts to individuals government                                   industry etc these broader systems are sometimes called sociotechnical systems they                                   include nontechnical elements such as people processes regulations etc as well as                                   technical components such as computers software and other equipment                                       sociotechnical    systems  are  so complex   that  it  is  practically   impossible    to                                   understand them as a whole rather you  have to view them  as layers as shown in                                   figure 101  these layers make up the sociotechnical   systems stack                                   1 the    equipment  layer this   layer  is  composed of  hardware  devices  some of                                          which may  be computers

in the system                                   3 the    communications and data management layer this layer extends the operat                                          ing system facilities  and provides an interface that allows interaction  with more                                          extensive functionality   such as access to remote systems access to a system                                          database etc this is sometimes called middleware as it is in between the appli                                          cation and the operating system                                   4 the    application  layer this   layer delivers the  applicationspecific  functionality                                          that is required there may be many different application programs in  this layer                                   5 the    business process layer at this  level the organizational business processes                                          which make use of the software system are defined and enacted                                   6 the   organizational layer this layer includes higherlevel strategic processes as well                                          as business rules policies and norms that should be followed when using the system                                   7 the    social layer at  this layer the laws and regulations of society that govern the                                          operation of the system are defined282                                                                                              chapter 10 \\x02

                        hiding  the detail  of  the layer  below  from  the layer  above in  practice  this is  not                                   always the case there can be unexpected interactions between layers which result                                   in problems for  the system as a whole for example say there is a change in the law                                   governing access to personal information this  comes from the social layer it  leads                                   to new organizational  procedures and changes to the business processes however                                   the application  system may not  be able to provide  the required  level of  privacy so                                   changes have to  be implemented   in  the communications   and  data management                                   layer                                       thinking   holistically   about systems rather than simply  considering  software in                                   isolation   it  is essential  when  considering   software  security  and  dependability                                   software failure in  itself rarely has serious consequences because software is intan                                   gible and even when damaged is easily and cheaply restored however when these                                   software failures ripple  through other  parts of the system they affect the softwares                                   physical and human environment here the consequences of failure are more signif                                   icant people may have to do  extra work  to contain or  recover from  the failure  for                                   example there may be physical damage to equipment data may be lost or corrupted                                   or confidentiality  may be breached with unknown  consequences                                       you  must therefore take a systemlevel  view  when you are designing  software                                   that has to be secure and dependable you need to understand the consequences of                                   software failures for  other elements in the system you also need to understand how                                   these other system elements may be the cause of software failures and how they can                                   help to protect against and recover from software failures                                       therefore  it  is a system rather  than a software  failure  that is the real  problem                                   this means that you need to examine how the software interacts with  its immediate                                   environment to ensure that                                   1 software    failures are as far as possible contained within the enclosing layers of                                          the system stack and do not seriously affect the operation of adjoining layers in                                          particular software failures  should not lead to system failures283266 chapter    10 \\x02 sociotechnical     systems                                   2 you    understand how faults and failures in the nonsoftware layers of the systems                                          stack may affect the software  you may also consider how checks may be built                                          into the software to  help detect these failures and how support can be provided                                          for recovering  from failure                                       as  software is  inherently flexible   unexpected system problems are often left  to                                   software engineers to solve say a radar installation has been sited so that ghosting of                                   the radar image occurs it is impractical to move the radar to a site with less interfer                                   ence so the systems engineers have to find another way of removing  this ghosting                                   their solution may be to enhance the imageprocessing capabilities of the software to                                   remove the ghost images this may slow down  the software so that its performance                                   becomes unacceptable the problem may then be characterized as a software failure                                   whereas in fact it is a failure in the design process for the system as a whole                                       this  sort of  situation  in which  software  engineers are left  with  the problem  of                                   enhancing software capabilities without  increasing hardware costs is very common                                   many socalled  software failures  are not a consequence of inherent software  prob                                   lems but rather are the result of trying to  change the software to accommodate mod                                   ified system engineering requirements a good example of this was the failure of  the

just the software in these                                   systems software is  the controlling   and integrating  element in  these systems and                                   software engineering costs are often the main cost component in  the overall system                                   costs as a software engineer it helps if  you have a broader awareness of how soft

        the term system is one that is universally used we talk about computer systems oper                                   ating systems payment systems the education system the system of government and so                                   on these are all obviously quite different uses of the word system although they share                                   the characteristic that somehow the system is more than simply the sum of its parts                                       abstract  systems such as the system of government are outside the scope of this                                   book rather i focus on systems that include computers and that have some specific                                   purpose such as to enable communication support navigation  or compute salaries                                   a useful working  definition  of  these types of systems is as follows                                       a  system is a purposeful  collection   of interrelated   components of  different                                       kinds  which work together to achieve some objective                                       this  general definition  embraces a vast range of systems for example a simple                                   system such as laser pointer may include a few hardware components plus a small284

components plus human users who make decisionsbased on information from that computer  system    a  characteristic of  all complex systems is that the properties and behavior of  thesystem components are  inextricably   intermingled  the  successful functioning   ofeach system component depends on the functioning of other components thus software can only operate if  the processor is operational the processor can only  carryout computations if  the software system defining  these computations has been successfully installed    complex   systems are usually   hierarchical  and  so include  other  systems forexample a police command  and control  system may include  a geographical information system to provide details of the location of incidents these included systemsare called subsystems  subsystems can  operate as independent systems in  theirown right  for example the same geographical information  system may be used insystems for transport logistics and emergency command and control    systems that include software fall  into two  categories1 technical    computerbased systems these are systems that include hardware and       software components but not procedures and processes examples of technical       systems include televisions  mobile phones and other equipment  with  embed       ded software most  software for  pcs computer games etc also falls into  this       category individuals  and organizations  use technical  systems for  a particular       purpose but knowledge of  this purpose is not  part of  the system for example       the word processor i am using is not aware that is it being used to write a book2 sociotechnical    systems these include one or  more technical  systems but cru       cially also include  people who understand the purpose of the system within the       system itself  sociotechnical  systems have defined  operational processes and       people the operators are inherent  parts of  the system they are governed  by       organizational  policies  and rules and may  be affected  by external  constraints       such as national laws and regulatory  policies for  example this book  was cre       ated through a sociotechnical publishing system that includes various processes       and technical systems    sociotechnical  systems are enterprise systems that are intended to help deliver abusiness goal this might be to  increase sales reduce material used in manufacturing collect  taxes maintain  a safe airspace etc because they are embedded in  anorganizational  environment the  procurement development  and use of  these systems are influenced by the organizations  policies and procedures and by its working culture  the users of the system are people who  are influenced by  the way  theorganization is managed and by their  interactions with  other people inside and outside of the organization    when  you are trying  to develop sociotechnical  systems you need to understandthe organizational environment in which they are used if you dont the systems maynot meet  business  needs and users  and their   managers may  reject  the  system285268 chapter    10 \\x02 sociotechnical     systems

system include                                   1 process    changes the system may require changes to the work processes in the                                          environment if  so training will  certainly be required if  changes are significant                                          or if  they involve  people losing  their  jobs there is a danger that the  users will                                          resist the introduction  of the system                                   2 job    changes new  systems may deskill  the  users in an environment  or  cause                                          them  to  change  the  way   they  work   if  so  users  may  actively   resist  the                                          introduction  of the system into the organization  designs that involve managers                                          having to  change their way of  working  to fit  a new computer  system are often                                          resented the managers may feel  that their  status in the organization  is  being                                          reduced by the system                                   3 organizational     changes the system may change the political power structure in                                          an organization for example if an organization is dependent on a complex sys                                          tem those who control access to that system have a great deal of political power                                       sociotechnical  systems have three characteristics that are particularly  important                                   when considering security and dependability                                   1 they     have emergent properties  that are properties  of  the system  as a whole                                          rather than associated with individual   parts of the system emergent properties                                          depend on both  the system  components and the  relationships  between them                                          given this  complexity  the emergent properties can only be evaluated once the                                          system has been assembled security  and dependability  are emergent system                                          properties                                   2 they    are often nondeterministic this means that when presented with a specific                                          input  they may  not always  produce  the same output  the systems behavior                                          depends on the human  operators and people do  not always  react in  the same                                          way furthermore use of the system may  create new relationships between the                                          system components and hence change its emergent behavior system faults and                                          failures may  therefore be transient and people may  disagree about whether or                                          not a failure has actually occurred                                   3 the    extent to which  the system supports organizational objectives does not just                                          depend on the system itself it  also depends on the stability of these objectives                                          the relationships and conflicts  between organizational objectives and how peo                                          ple in the organization interpret these objectives new management may reinter                                          pret the organizational  objectives that a system was designed to support so that                                          a successful system may then be seen as a failure                                       sociotechnical  considerations are often  critical  in  determining  whether or not  a                                   system has successfully met its objectives unfortunately  taking  these into account                                   is very difficult  for  engineers who have little experience of social or cultural  studies286                                                                                                                   101 \\x02 complex    systems 269    property
